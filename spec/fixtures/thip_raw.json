We searched and found that the tweet has been shared by a bot that automatically retweets health-related posts shared on Twitter by other accounts. The claimed Twitter post has received 436 retweets, 14 quote tweets, and 1,935 likes till we last checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can vitamin D cure cancer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. The available research does not confirm vitamin D cures all cancer. The available research only speculates whether vitamin D can kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells and prevent the formation of new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/vitamin-d-fact-sheet\">National Cancer Institute (NCI) website</a></span> informs that exposure to sunlight produces vitamin D. So, researchers hypothesize that a change in vitamin D level might allow cancer-causing components to affect normal cell functioning and cause cancer. Also, this website shows that available evidence is insufficient to confirm that high vitamin D intake lowers cancer incidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/07123259/Dr-Sarthak-Moharir.jpg\" alt=\"Sarthak Moharir, Radiation Oncologist\" class=\"wp-image-32018\" srcset=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/07123259/Dr-Sarthak-Moharir.jpg 200w, https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/07123259/Dr-Sarthak-Moharir-150x152.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr Sarthak Moharir</strong>, <strong>(MBBS, MD, Radiation Oncology), Consultant Radiation Oncologist at HCG Cancer Centre in Vadodara, Gujarat</strong>, informs, &#8220;Vitamin D doesn’t cure any cancer. No study proves the same. Vitamin D deficiency is notoriously common in India despite being a sunny country. So, vitamin D supplements are frequently prescribed to patients because cancer treatment leads to decreased food intake and hence decreased vitamin consumption.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr Manish Singha</strong>l, <strong>Senior Oncologist, Apollo Hospital, Delhi</strong>, in an interview with THIP MEDIA explained that vitamin D has a preventive role and can avoid cancer relapse. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Trying to get Vitamin D through Sunlight?\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVtFhR7MA6Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is vitamin D treatment for breast cancer approved in India?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not seem so. Indian doctors do not recommend Vitamin D as a chemotherapy drug.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr Moharir </strong>further informs, &#8220;Vitamin D supplements are pointedly given to breast cancer patients because breast cancer treatment frequently involves female hormone blockers. Female hormones are essential for bone health so they need supplements of vitamin D. Vitamin D does not cure any cancer nor is listed as a treatment of choice in any national or international guideline’.
