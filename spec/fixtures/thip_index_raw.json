The precise cause of the condition is unknown; however, it is caused by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36266581/\">familial influences</a></span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36266581/\">incorrect immune responses to environmental triggers, such as a virus or bacteria</a></span>, which induce bowel inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can the juices of cucumber, pineapple, and ginger aid in the reduction of intestinal inflammation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, there is no compelling evidence. Although the herbal juice containing pineapple, cucumbers, and ginger may aid in digestion and detoxification, there is no evidence that the three ingredients may reduce gut inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281613779_Nutritional_Value_and_Medicinal_Benefits_of_Pineapple\">Pineapple is a natural anti-inflammatory</a></span> fruit that influences digestion. It is high in calcium and potassium and low in fat and cholesterol. It is high in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306017037_Benefits_and_uses_of_pineapple\">vitamins B1, C, and B6, as well as copper antioxidants and dietary fiber</a></span>. Bromelain has been shown to play an important role in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306017037_Benefits_and_uses_of_pineapple\">reducing swelling in inflammatory conditions such as acute sinusitis, sore throat, arthritis, and gout</a></span>, as well as in speeding recovery from injuries and surgery. In contrast, pineapple has no effect on gut inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cucumber is a nutritious fruit with numerous health benefits. It regulates <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351580539_Health_Beneficial_Effects_of_Cucumber#:~:text=Cucumber%20regulates%20hydration%20and%20maintain,vitamin%20A%2C%20C%2C%20K.\">hydration, blood pressure, and sugar levels; soothes the skin; aids digestion; reduces fat, and helps with weight loss</a></span>.

Cucumber has several health benefits, but our research did not find enough evidence to support its role in reducing intestinal inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ginger has <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129720_Ginger_An_Overview_of_Health_Benefits\">anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129720_Ginger_An_Overview_of_Health_Benefits\">.</a> It has also traditionally been used to treat diarrhea, stomach upset, indigestion, nausea, and menstrual irregularities. Furthermore, there is scientific evidence that ginger can help with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129720_Ginger_An_Overview_of_Health_Benefits\">nausea and vomiting after pregnancy, surgery, or motion sickness, as well as inflammation and pain</a></span>. Nevertheless, it does not contribute to reducing gut inflammation. Although ginger is generally considered to be safe, it can sometimes cause minor side effects such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129720_Ginger_An_Overview_of_Health_Benefits\">heartburn, gastric irritation, diarrhea, and even abdominal pain</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We checked with dietician, Kamna Chauhan, if cucumber, pineapple, and ginger juices could help reduce intestinal inflammation. She explained that, &#8220;The juice recipe could help relieve the symptoms, but only if consumed in moderation. This is due to the high nutrient content of the three ingredients. Cucumbers are high in vitamins K, B, and C, as well as minerals like potassium and magnesium, which may help to &#8216;cool&#8217; an induced inflammatory response in the body. While pineapple is high in vitamins, minerals, and bromelain, it may have an anti-inflammatory effect, and ginger is a natural cyclooxygenase inhibitor with a variety of other anti-inflammatory characteristics. So, when they&#8217;re all combined in a juice recipe, intestinal inflammation could be reduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is dietary intervention useful in reducing gut inflammation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a well-balanced diet is essential for reducing intestinal inflammation. Consuming too few nutrient-dense foods may increase the risk of malnutrition, and inadequate nutrition can cause fatigue and make healing difficult. This is because GI tract inflammation and symptoms such as diarrhea and stomach pain could prevent adequate nutrient, fluid, and electrolyte absorption. Thus, dietary management necessitates the participation of both the physician and the dietician. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31812656/\">Multivitamins, limited dairy products</a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30711211/\">consuming gluten free diet</a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31812656/\">small meals, and plenty of liquids</a></span> are typically prescribed to patients with intestinal inflammation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE:</strong> We conclude that while the herbal juice recipe may aid in detoxification, it may not be effective in relieving intestinal swelling completely.

Since dental discoloration is not always external, the administration of strawberries is not acceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Fact Check</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What exactly is tooth discoloration?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342520945_Discoloration_of_Teeth_A_Literature_Review\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tooth discoloration</span></a> is a common dental observation that is associated with both clinical and cosmetic issues. It varies in the underlying cause, appearance, composition, location, severity, and firmness of adherence to the tooth surface. The discoloration could be caused by both external and internal factors. It should be noted that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825865/\">intrinsic discoloration is usually caused by a congenital or systemic condition</a></span>. While <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9120149/\">external variables such as coffee, tea, tobacco, and medications, as well as aging</a>,</span> can cause external discoloration, certain factors, such as enamel defects, salivary composition, salivary flow rates, and poor oral hygiene, increase the risk of external dental deposits and stain accumulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is it possible for strawberries to remove external tooth discoloration?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915121/\">Strawberries</a></span> are thought to have teeth-whitening characteristics. However, these properties are ineffective and short-lived. This is due to the fact that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25279797/\">applying strawberries to the tooth surface</a></span> has a temporary effect on the removal of dental plaque and external tooth stains. This transient whitening effect could be attributed to the presence of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Change-of-malic-acid-content-of-strawberries-during-cold-storage-mg-g_fig3_49591552\">malic acid, a naturally occurring tooth whitene</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Change-of-malic-acid-content-of-strawberries-during-cold-storage-mg-g_fig3_49591552\">r</a>. Furthermore, mature <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842844/\">strawberries contain citric acid</a></span>, which might whiten teeth when applied to them.

This <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20831581/\">eventually weakens the tooth enamel, making it susceptible to sensitivity and even tooth decay</a></span>. In other words, since this acid dissolves tooth enamel, any whitening benefit is negligible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16183705/pooja-bharadwaj-dentist-e1666611260772.jpg\" alt=\"Pooja Bhardwaj, BDS\" class=\"wp-image-23131\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When we asked <strong>Dr. Pooja Bhardwaj (BDS)</strong>, if strawberries could help with tooth discoloration, she explained that, &#8220;Strawberries contain natural sugars as well as citric and malic acids. Malic acid may be a natural enamel cleanser, but there is no solid evidence to support this, and it might remove surface food debris, leaving a cleaner-looking tooth surface. Strawberry citric acid, on the other hand, has the potential to demineralize enamel. Strawberries&#8217; natural sugars can cause cavities if not properly cleansed. As a result, using strawberries to remove external stains is ineffective and causes more harm than good. Your dentist may now recommend a variety of low-cost teeth-whitening options.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/16182856/Dr-Paridhi-Garg-2-e1648542232374.jpg\" alt=\"Endodontist\" class=\"wp-image-28845\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <strong>endodontist, Dr. Paridhi Garg</strong>, also said, &#8220;Strawberries do not whiten teeth.&#8221; Strawberries contain citric acid, which damages enamel and accelerates the demineralization process, which can cause sensitivity issues. Strawberries are also high in sugar, which increases the risk of tooth decay and cavities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to dismissing the role of strawberries in teeth whitening, THIP Media has brushed aside the roles of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-does-rubbing-teeth-with-orange-peel-remove-stains-and-whiten-them/32302/\">orange peels</a>,</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-can-apple-cider-vinegar-whiten-teeth-effectively/35549/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">apple cider vinegar</a></span>, and the <a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-can-lemon-and-baking-soda-act-as-an-effective-teeth-whitener/36654/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">paste of lemon and baking soda</span></a> in teeth whitening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can tooth discoloration be handled?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, both external and internal tooth staining can be managed by a dentist to some extent. Prior to beginning treatment, a thorough dental and medical history should be obtained. This exploration would include the use of pharmaceuticals and orally administered therapeutic agents. Additionally, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825865/\">occupational chemical exposure, oral hygiene practices, and habitual beverage consumption should be examined</a></span>. The dental professional must examine the position and distribution of the stain, enamel roughness, defect, cavities, or faulty restoration, as well as plaque and calculus deposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that the external stains can be addressed once the underlying cause has been identified. As a result, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227889905_Dental_Discoloration_An_Overview\">therapy incorporates proper tooth brushing techniques, toothpaste, and professional cleaning</a></span>. In terms of dietary sources of stains, patients should be advised to<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227889905_Dental_Discoloration_An_Overview\">limit their consumption of stain-inducing beverages such as coffee and tea and encouraged to brush their teeth immediately after consumption</a></span>. Employees who work with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227889905_Dental_Discoloration_An_Overview\">industrial chemicals should try to wear masks</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to extrinsic stains, which occur on the surfaces of teeth, intrinsic stains are caused by the incorporation of chromogenic components into enamel and dentin before or after tooth development. Internal stains include <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10086925/\">dental fluorosis</a></span>, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227889905_Dental_Discoloration_An_Overview\">tetracycline stain, inherited developmental defects of enamel or dentin without systemic features, and blood-related disorders</a></span>. As a result, identifying and treating the underlying cause of internal tooth discoloration is critical. The main treatment options are enamel surface smoothening, placing a thin cosmetic layer on the affected tooth surfaces, or vital and non-vital bleaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE:</strong> Strawberries may be safe, but they are ineffective stain removers. In reality, the whitening effect of strawberries on teeth is temporary and may not be effective in removing all types of external stains, which may necessitate professional removal. Furthermore, the acidic nature of the fruit may be more harmful than beneficial to the teeth. Brushing twice a day and flossing once a day is, therefore, the most effective way to keep the teeth clean and plaque-free and one should always seek the advice of a dentist for the best results. Therefore, we conclude that the assertion is mostly false.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can strawberries help with tooth discoloration? No, not at all.

This can be result of prolonged high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. This results in the formation of ketones, which accumulate in the blood and urine, potentially making one feel nauseous.</div>\n<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which pregnant women have abnormal blood glucose levels. This increase in insulin resistance is a result of the placental secretion of diabetogenic hormones such as growth hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, placental lactogen, and progesterone. Many women with gestational diabetes have no or only minor symptoms. Fatigue, excessive thirst, blurred vision, frequent urination, weight loss despite an increased appetite, nausea, and vomiting are all possible symptoms. Nonetheless, in a few cases, mild nausea can be severe. This is known as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872159/\">hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)</a></span>. This article summarizes the possibility of developing and the management of nausea in pregnant women with gestational diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-nausea-and-vomiting-common-during-pregnancy\">Are nausea and vomiting common during pregnancy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, nausea and vomiting are common during pregnancy, but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28499531/\">they are mostly self-limiting and resolve by 16–20 weeks of gestation</a></span>, with a brief reappearance around the 32nd week due to a surge in hormones. Many women may experience it throughout their pregnancy, making even the most basic tasks impossible. Hence, pregnant women with such experiences require reassurance and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do pregnant women experience nausea when they are diagnosed with GD?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The underlying cause of nausea during pregnancy is unknown, but it is probably a result of a combination of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28499531/\">genetic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, environmental, and psychosocial factors</a></span>. However, having high blood sugar levels for an extended period of time during pregnancy may also cause nausea. This process results in the formation of ketones, which accumulate in the blood and urine. During pregnancy, these ketones may make one feel nauseous more than usual. Hence, hyperemesis gravidarum and gestational diabetes are a nightmare to manage. This is because food is the enemy of hyperemesis, and a nutritious diet is a necessity for gestational diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How can nausea caused by gestational diabetes be managed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are psychological, non-drug, and medicine-based treatments available for pregnant women who are experiencing nausea and vomiting, especially if they have gestational diabetes. Reassuring women that nausea is a normal part of pregnancy, that it will pass, and that it will not harm their baby plays a crucial role.<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2565291\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2565291\">Non-drug treatments for nausea during pregnancy include dietary changes, psychosocial interventions, and behavioral interventions</a></span>. Adequate hydration is essential for the management of the condition. You can also relieve the symptoms of nausea caused by gestational diabetes by eating bland, dry foods in small amounts and staying hydrated. Moreover, you should avoid triggers such as certain odors and foods. You should see your doctor on a regular basis to ensure proper management.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do I have nausea due to gestational diabetes?

This includes women with undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes as well as those who have their first episode of high blood sugar during pregnancy. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), as well as the American Diabetes Association and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832911/\">recommend assessing high-risk populations to identify previously undiagnosed diabetes in pregnant women</a></span>. This article focuses on the ideal time and tests to screen and monitor gestational diabetes and the population that is more likely to develop the condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-who-is-more-likely-to-develop-gestational-diabetes\">Who is more likely to develop gestational diabetes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Women with a previous history of gestational diabetes, family history, Asian or Caribbean ethnicity and obesity are at a higher risk. However, some women without these risk factors may also develop gestational diabetes and the condition may go unattended. Thus, all pregnant women should be screened for high blood glucose levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the most accurate method of diagnosing gestational diabetes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832911/\">WHO </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832911/\">recommends oral glucose challenge tolerance test (OGTT)</a></span>.<br>This is because it has a high sensitivity and follows the same diagnostic criteria as nonpregnant adults. Nevertheless, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14747263/\">OGTT&#8217;s key drawbacks</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14747263/\"> </a>are that it is expensive and inconvenient for some women. A random plasma glucose test, a glycated hemoglobin test, and a glucosuria examination are some other tests. However, these are not preferred because they overlook a large proportion of women with gestational diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When should blood sugar levels be monitored in gestational diabetes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is disagreement about the best time to test women for gestational diabetes. The timing is critical because due to the burden on pregnant women and the limited resources of healthcare services, the screening test should ideally be performed only once during pregnancy. Simultaneously, earlier diagnosis and treatment of any woman with the condition could assist in avoiding adverse perinatal outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women with previously undiagnosed diabetes can be identified when the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483271/\">screening test for gestational diabetes is administered during the first three months</a></span>. This test can also identify early-onset as well as newly occurring diabetes. Women at high risk, such as those who had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, are frequently offered <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24282036/\">OGTT during the first three months</a></span>. However, the majority of physiological pregnancy-related changes in insulin sensitivity occur during the second trimester. Therefore, testing in the first trimester may miss a large proportion of women who might develop the condition. As a result, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6483271/\">high-risk women who have a normal first-trimester test should take a second test later in pregnancy</a></span>. Most women are offered a single test in the late second trimester to avoid the need for repeated testing. This timing is to strike a balance between testing too soon and testing too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If gestational diabetes is confirmed, the doctor will advise you to get frequent checkups, particularly in the last three months of pregnancy.

When the operation is performed under local anesthesia, the patient stays awake during the procedure, i.e., in fistulotomy. If the fistula is small and shallow, the patient may only need a local anesthetic during the procedure. Otherwise, a surgeon will put them to sleep using a general anesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-long-does-a-fistula-operation-take\">How long does a fistula operation take?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different types of surgeries are performed to treat a fistula. The surgery duration depends upon many factors, such as the location of the fistula, its severity and any other possible complications of the surgery. The surgeon has to decide the procedure based on his past experience and the type of fistula he/she is dealing with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surgery can be transabdominal surgery, in which the fistula is accessed through an abdominal wall incision. It can be a laparoscopic surgery, which is a minimally invasive surgery involving a tiny incision and using cameras and small tools to repair the fistula. The duration of these procedures is different depending on the patient’s condition. The operation is usually performed under a general anesthetic, but various anesthetic techniques are possible. The operation usually takes 15 to 30 minutes but can even be variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is fistula operation a painful procedure?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. The operation is usually done under general anesthesia, which means that the patient will be asleep during the operation. Some procedures can also be done using regional anesthesia, meaning the patient will be awake during the operation, but the lower part of the body will be numb. However, a patient may experience mild to moderate pain or discomfort following fistulotomy. You may also experience constipation, difficulty urinating, and possibly some rectal bleeding. The pain or discomfort post-surgery can be managed with analgesics (painkillers).</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What does a patient experiences during a fistula surgery?

Ayurveda not only treats the symptoms but is a holistic approach to migraine treatment. Ayurveda targets the cause and other chemical activities that spread the disease. The focus is on aggravating and relieving factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which <em>doshas</em> in ayurveda cause migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayurveda explains that migraine occurs due to an imbalance of <em>Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas</em>. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/ask-the-expert-headaches\">Mapi.com</a></span> informs that migraine is more dependent on <em>Pitta-Vata</em> imbalance. This website further explains that an imbalance of <em>Pitta dosh</em> causes burning, searing, and sharp pain. This pain exacerbates by visual sensation and light sensitivity. Other factors include excessive heat and eye strain. Also, an ineffective digestive system, excessive stress, and exposure to environmental pollution further aggravate migraine pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another website <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://vibrantayurveda.com.au/ayurvedic-management-of-migraine/\">VibrantAyurveda.com</a></span> explains that migraine is called <em>Suryavartha soola</em> in ayurveda. <em>Surya</em> means sun and <em>avartha</em> means arise of affliction.

Hospitalisation is required for five days after surgery. It might take around 6 to 8 weeks to recover fully. Recovery times can also vary depending on the type of hysterectomy. This procedure also comes with a risk of complications during and post-surgery. Also, hysterectomy is also linked with a few age-linked changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-a-hysterectomy-cause-any-complications\">Can a hysterectomy cause any complications?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, uterus removal surgery is very safe, but with any major surgery comes the risk of complications. Risks associated with an abdominal hysterectomy include blood clots, infection, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short-term effects of a hysterectomy can be bleeding, pain and hormonal fluctuations. Laparoscopic procedure may have a lower risk of complications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complications during the procedure can be bladder or bowel damage, vaginal problems, ovary failure, vaginal problems, ureter damage, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2018/05000/Cardiovascular_and_metabolic_morbidity_after.6.aspx?fbclid=IwAR16AHWVNhYu4u7qGKeh1DSDTEiKLXg0VPibAuWUCFIbWkqsb2INXche3S0\">an article published in the North American Menopause Society</a></span>, especially in women with hysterectomy after 35 years of age, there is an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as per <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096186/\">a study published in The Ochsner Journal</a></span> stated that major intraoperative complication rate was 3.9%, and the major postoperative complication rate was 4.7%, referring to a good success rate of the operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will a uterus removal surgery lead to age-related changes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. In cases of a hysterectomy, if the ovaries are also removed, it could cause hormonal changes depending on whether the person is premenopausal or postmenopausal, leading to an increased risk of age-related issues like bone loss, memory loss, and more. The removal of ovaries leads to menopause, leading to a drastic reduction in estrogen. The sudden loss of estrogen can lead to other health issues, like coronary heart disease, stroke, and depression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223258/\">research</a></span> states that the women who had premenopausal hysterectomy must closely monitor the bone density or cardiovascular risk factors as this procedure has a possible risk of early ovarian failure.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is uterus removal surgery a serious one?

रूप से मध्य अमेरिका का फल है। यह उष्णकटिबंधीय क्षेत्र (Tropical Regions) में ज्यादा पाए जाते हैं और जहां भरपूर वर्षा होती है लेकिन लंबे समय तक बाढ़ नहीं आती वहां भी पपीता का फल सामान्यतौर पर पाया जाता है। वहीं ठंड का तापमान पपीते की फसल को नुकसान पहुंचा सकता है। फल के अतिरिक्त पपीता के बीजों का भी उपयोग कई स्वास्थ्य संबंधित स्थितियों में किया जाता है। </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>किन पोषक तत्वों</strong> <strong>से भरपूर है पपीता?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-papaya\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">पपीता</span> </a>में भारी मात्रा में एंटी-ऑक्सीडेंट जैसे विटामिन-ए, विटामिन-सी और विटामिन-ई पाए जाते हैं, जिनसे हार्ट अटैक होने का खतरा कम होता है। पपीता में भारी मात्रा में फाइबर मौजूद होते हैं, जो कोलेस्ट्रोल को कम करने में मदद करते हैं। पपीता में मौजूद फॉलिक एसिड <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-papaya\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Homocysteine amino acid</span> </a>को कम हानिकारक amino acid में बदल देता है। </p>\n\n\n\n<p>मांसाहारी भोजन में Homocysteine amino acid पर्याप्त मात्रा में होते हैं, जो हार्ट अटैक का कारक बनता है इसलिए पपीता का सेवन करना हार्ट अटैक को कम करता है। पपीता में दो तरह के एंजाइम- papain और chymopapain पाए जाते हैं, जो पाचन शक्ति को बढ़ाने के साथ-साथ शरीर की सूजन को कम करने के साथ अर्थराइटिस और अस्थमा की संभावनाओं को कम करते हैं। </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>क्या गर्भावस्था में पपीता खाने से <strong>गर्भपात</strong></strong> <strong>होता है

It was earlier used as an over-the-counter drug for various ailments, such as several infections, hay fever, skin conditions, etc., but in September 1999, the<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=310.548\">FDA</a></span> ruled that it was not safe to use. It was believed to be extremely useful for wound dressings as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is RSV?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RSV, or<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nfid.org/infectious-diseases/rsv/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nfid.org/infectious-diseases/rsv/\">Respiratory syncytial Virus</a></span>, is a common respiratory virus. It causes mild, cold-like symptoms infecting the nose, throat, lungs, and breathing passages. Generally, most people recover within a week or two. However, in cases of infants or older adults, RSV can be serious. This seasonal lung infection is highly contagious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html\">CDC</a>,</span> it is the most common cause of pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) in children younger than one year of age in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It spreads either through direct contacts, such as coming in contact with respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, or kissing) from an infected person or indirect contact, such as touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can colloidal silver treat RSV?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. There is a lack of scientific evidence that proves that colloidal silver can treat RSV. The CDC states that<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/symptoms.html\">there is no specific treatment for RSV infection</a></span>. However, research is going on to develop vaccines and antivirals (medicines that fight viruses).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723559/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723559/\">study done on mouse demonstrated that </a></span>AgNPs (silver nanoparticles) effectively reduce RSV replication and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in epithelial cell lines in mouse lung. Similarly, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233505657_Silver_Nanoparticles_Inhibit_Replication_of_Respiratory_Syncytial_Virus\">another study also concluded that</a></span> PVP-coated (poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) silver nanoparticles seem to be a promising candidate for future RSV treatment research in animal models. However, animal studies are needed to further confirm this result. Also, colloidal silver is regarded as not safe to use and it was banned by FDA to be used to treat any condition or disease. The silver can also impact the healthy cells and while killing the bacteria, it can also lead cause death of normal cells. Therefore, the claim stands false until proven otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the side effects of using colloidal silver?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/colloidal-silver#:~:text=What%20Is%20Colloidal%20Silver%3F,be%20dangerous%20to%20your%20health.\"> National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a></span>, “The most common is argyria, a bluish-gray skin discoloration, which is usually permanent.” In argyria, the silver deposits may also occur in your intestines, liver, kidneys, and other organs. It further states that it can also cause “poor absorption of some drugs, such as certain antibiotics and thyroxine (used to treat thyroid deficiency).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in rare cases, its high dose can cause serious side effects, such as neurological impairment, seizures and organ damage. Lastly, if taken in large amounts, it can even cause fatal poisoning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>THIP Media has fact-checked similar claims that stated that <a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-can-colloidal-silver-be-used-to-treat-various-ailments/33585/\">c</a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-can-colloidal-silver-be-used-to-treat-various-ailments/33585/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">olloidal silver is used to treat various ailments </a></span>and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"https://www.thip.media/health-news-fact-check/fact-check-are-covid-vaccines-responsible-for-increasing-rsv-cases/38007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">COVID vaccines responsible for increasing RSV cases.</a></span></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can colloidal silver treat different ailments?

The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11735659/\">risks of self-medication</a></span> can result in misdiagnosis and incorrect drug selection, delays in seeking appropriate treatments, use of excessive drugs or lower dosages, and prolonged use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-medication is different from preventive home remedies.

It should be noted that neurological complications are more common in children.</div>\n<p><em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> Malaria is the leading cause of body damage, hospitalisation&nbsp;and even death in children. Since&nbsp;several theories exist to explain the complications of malaria that result in high mortality rates. This article discusses the neurological complication of malaria, its clinical indicators, and whether such a severe complication can be survived.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can malaria permanently damage the body?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, malaria can be fatal in some cases. Malaria infection has a profound effect on the body, with long-term health consequences ranging from increased susceptibility to bacterial infection to cognitive impairment. Healthy patients can control their infection because they develop immunity to the parasite. Whereas the people who have been exposed are unable to rid themselves of the condition. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001942\">This has an effect on treatment since they no longer develop a fever</a></span>. The resulting chronic yet silent infection not only contributes to the perpetuation of malaria transmission but also to serious health and developmental impairments over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2021\">World Health Organization</a></span>, severe malaria infections may result in acute organ failures, abnormal cell counts, and metabolic abnormalities. The most severe neurological complication of malaria infection is cerebral malaria (CM). Children in Sub-Saharan Africa are the most affected, and those who survive frequently have life-long disorders that can have a significant impact on their quality of life. These primarily include impairments in cognition, motor skills, and visual coordination, as well as seizures and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the main clinical indicators of cerebral malaria?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Malaria is the leading cause of death in endemic areas, accounting for 80% of fatal cases. Cerebral malaria is a condition in which <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1968190/\">the patient is not able to respond to a painful stimulus</a></span>, and neurological complications affect 50% of children admitted to the hospital. Typically, the first symptoms appear 10 to 15 days after the bite. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19347024/\">High fever, muscle aches, headaches, sweating, and other flu symptoms are among the symptoms</a></span>. In children and immunocompromised patients, the first signs may appear within the first six to twelve hours. Such patients may show symptoms like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19347024/\">nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, an increased heart rate, arthralgias, and liver or spleen damage</a></span>. Neurological alterations in the brain can cause <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21847328/\">seizures, ocular manifestations</a></span>, and even <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21923924/\">coma</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-it-possible-to-recover-from-cerebral-malaria\">Is it possible to recover from cerebral malaria?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The mortality rate for cerebral malaria is high. Three independent factors can lead to this increased mortality. These factors include advanced age, coma, and the extent of parasitic infestation. The treatment of complications such as <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19347024/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">renal failure, severe jaundice, and metabolic acidosis has a significant impact on the prognosis of CM</span></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24198884/\">90% of CM patients recover without neurological complications</a></span>.

Also, adequate sleep and no drug abuse can further help manage their symptoms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the answer below, we have explained the role of aerobic exercises in controlling migraine and other related questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-exercise-cure-migraine\">Can exercise cure migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. Exercise alone cannot cure migraine completely. But it is essential for people with migraine to incorporate exercise into their routine. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942090/\">Scant evidence</a></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6134860/\">shows that</a></span> regular exercise can reduce the number of migraine days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1129-2377-14-99\">research paper published in 2013</a></span> informs that a high-intensity workout might not be good for migraine patients. People with migraine have a defective metabolic system. This can lead to a rise in blood lactate. A higher quantity may deposit in the brain to increase the frequency of migraine. So, this can be a reason why some people with migraine suffer from frequent attacks after high-intensity exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can aerobic exercise help control migraine pain?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Aerobic exercise can drastically reduce the risk of migraine attacks. Regular aerobic exercise reduces the severity and frequency of migraine attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-019-0961-8\">research paper published in 2019</a></span> reviewed all published studies that analyzed the effect of aerobic exercise on the number of migraine days, duration, and pain intensity in migraine. This review informs that mild to moderate aerobic exercise can reduce the severity and frequency of migraine attacks. However, no evidence confirms that regular aerobic exercise cures the pain and reduces the duration of an attack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which aerobic exercise can reduce migraine pain?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking or cycling for a few minutes can help reduce migraine. Some people can also get benefits from cycling, rowing, and using an elliptical trainer or body ergometer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regularly swimming can benefit some people with migraine. However, a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200682/\">research paper published in 2004</a></span> has shown that swimming is a common migraine trigger.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can cardio exercises like running or cycling be a remedy to migraine?

It can happen between two organs or vessels in the body and can be in various parts of the body. Some of the common ones are anal, urinary tract and gastrointestinal fistulas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first line of treatment is through medications, such as antibiotics. There are various types of fistula treatment. In this article, we have discussed those types.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-the-different-ways-to-treat-fistula\">What are the different ways to treat fistula?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fistulectomy is a surgical procedure in which the fistula tract is completely removed under general anesthesia. The doctor removes the fistula tract and leaves the remaining groove to heal. Whereas Ksharsutra is an ancient Ayurvedic technique. Here, the fistula is treated through a special thread. This thread is coated with ayurvedic preparations. Then, it is inserted into the fistula tract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-is-crohns-disease/treatment/surgery/fistula-removal\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Crohns Colitis Foundation</span></a> states that various surgical options can treat fistula. The options also include closing the fistula with a medical plug and allowing it to heal. Another option is using a thin surgical cord, called seton. The seton is put inside the fistula to drain the infection and promote healing. Sometimes, doctors open up the fistula through an incision, allowing it to heal and, finally, using medical glue to close it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/mib102/chapter/The-technology#:~:text=VAAFT%20is%20claimed%20to%20be,muscle%20function%20and%20faecal%20continence.\">VAAFT</a></span> refers to Video Assisted Anal Fistula Treatment. With VAAFT, the surgeon is able to see inside the anal fistula tract. The surgeon then located the internal opening with the help of an endoscope light. It affects the fistula tract. This procedure preserves sphincter muscle function and fecal continence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anal-fistula/treatment/#:~:text=LIFT%20procedure,sphincter%20muscles%20are%20moved%20apart.\">NHS</a></span> defines the LIFT procedure, or the ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract procedure, as the procedure that passes through the anal sphincter muscles. This is done when a fistulotomy poses a high risk. During LIFT, a cut is made in the skin above the fistula, and the sphincter muscles are moved apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24119103/#:~:text=Aim%3A%20Fistula%20laser%20closure%20(FiLaC,connected%20to%20a%20diode%20laser.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fistula laser closure (FiLaC™)</span></a> is a procedure done to save the sphincter while treating the anal fistula.

However, none of these papers talks about the instant effect of ginger on the plaque in the veins. This means people with heart problem can incorporate ginger in their routine diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We researched the claimant and found that the speaker in the video is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/ayurveda-and-meditation-guru-acharya-manish-ji-a-life-dedicated-to-take-ayurveda-to-peoples-doorsteps/cid/1849959\">Acharya Manish Ji</a></span>.

Rammanohar, Research Director, Amrita School of Ayurveda</strong> to explain the take of Ayurveda on ginger curing heart blockage. To this, he said, &#8220;Home remedies like eating ginger immediately after a heart attack cannot instantly remove heart blockages. It takes months and years to remove heart blockages after following a strict diet and lifestyle. No medicine has been able to remove blockages till now. Delaying immediate treatment due to such claims can become serious for the person suffering from heart attack.&#8221;<br>Dr Dean Ornish, a cardiologist from the USA has <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ornish.com/undo-it/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">demonstrated</span></a> that removing heart blockages with diet and lifestyle depends upon what you eat, how you manage stress, how much you move and how much love and support you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claims like these are quite common on social media.

This is because <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26430297/\">bromelain can act directly on the tooth pellicle, degrading the tooth-adhering proteins and assisting in stain removal</a></span>.

As a result, more substantial evidence would be required to establish the role of pineapple juice in tooth and gum strengthening.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16183705/pooja-bharadwaj-dentist-e1666611260772.jpg\" alt=\"Pooja Bhardwaj, BDS\" class=\"wp-image-23131\" width=\"177\" height=\"177\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked <strong>Dr. Pooja Bhardwaj (BDS)</strong>, our dental expert, if drinking pineapple juice could help strengthen gums and teeth. She stated, &#8220;Pineapple contains calcium, which might aid in the strengthening of teeth and bones. It is the only source of bromelain, which naturally removes plaque and minor stains. Pineapple contains a lot of vitamin C, which could help with collagen synthesis in the dentin. In addition to that, xylitol in pineapple also helps fight oral bacteria to keep the breath fresh. It might aid in the growth, repair, and prevention of gum disease. Despite their numerous benefits, home remedies such as pineapple should not be relied on exclusively. For healthy teeth and gums, a six-month dental checkup is recommended.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be emphasized that the strength of the teeth and gums necessitates both personal and professional care. Brushing and flossing properly, eating a healthy diet, and visiting the dentist on a regular basis all contribute to good oral health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is nutrition important in the maintenance of oral health?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Nutrition, as a pillar of human development, has an impact on both general and oral health. Oral health necessitates the regular availability of vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other micronutrients. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30293649/\">Micronutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E, folic acid, and calcium have a significant impact on periodontal health</a>.</span> Furthermore, their deficiencies may increase the risk of tooth decay, gum diseases, oral cancer, and other mouth diseases. It should also be noted that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30293649/\">foods high in fat and carbohydrates, such as pasta, cheese, red meat, and fried foods, are significantly linked to the incidence of dental and oral problems</a></span>. Thus, a healthy mouth necessitates an interdisciplinary approach that includes both preventive measures and adequate nutrition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE:</strong> Pineapple juice is a natural, readily available, and cost-effective product, and the natural components of bromelain, as well as better acceptance, may be an advantage. However, our research found very little evidence supporting its preventive role in teeth and gums, implying that it cannot be solely responsible for oral health maintenance. Furthermore, due to its acidic nature, daily consumption of pineapple juice is not recommended. Therefore, we conclude that the assertion is mostly false.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can pineapple juice help in maintaining oral health? No, not at all.

सर्दी-जुकाम से राहत पाने के लिए किया जाता है। यह अमेरीकी कंपनी Procter &amp; Gamble का उत्पाद है। विक्स की आधिकारिक वेबसाइट द्वारा दी गई जानकारी के अनुसार विक्स के मुख्य अवयवों में कपूर, नीलगिरी का तेल और मेन्थॉल मौजूद होते हैं, जो कफ, सर्दी-जुकाम में राहत पहुंचाने का काम करते हैं। इसके अलावा विक्स में देवदार का तेल, जायफल का तेल, petrolatum, thymol and turpentine oil (तारपीन का तेल) भी मौजूद होता है।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>कैसे करें विक्स का उपयोग?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>विक्स की आधिकारिक वेबसाइट द्वारा दी गई जानकारी के अनुसार विक्स का उपयोग केवल सर्दी-जुकाम में ही किया जा सकता है। इसके अलावा एक दिन में केवल तीन बार ही विक्स का इस्तेमाल करना चाहिए। विक्स का प्रयोग गले, छाती या मामूली जोड़ों के दर्द में किया जा सकता है, जिसके लिए चिकित्सीय सलाह बेहद जरुरी है। साथ ही विक्स का उपयोग दो वर्ष से अधिक के बच्चों पर ही किया जाना चाहिए। इसके अलावा विक्स को किसी बर्तन में पानी गर्म करने के दौरान भी नहीं डालना चाहिए क्योंकि इससे जलने की आशंका होती है। </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>क्या है कपूर?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-709/camphor#:~:text=Camphor%20is%20a%20chemical%20that,such%20as%20pain%20and%20itching.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">कपूर</span></a> को कपूर की पेड़ की छाल से निकाला जाता है। हालांकि अब कपूर को तारपीन के तेल से भी प्राप्त किया जाने लगा है। कपूर का इस्तेमाल मुख्य रुप से पूजा-पाठ आदि में किया जाता है मगर कपूर कई औषधीय गुणों से भरपूर भी होता है। इस <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.1mg.com/ayurveda/camphor-41\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">आलेख</span></a> के अनुसार आयुर्वेदिक पद्धति में कपूर का इस्तेमाल नारियल तेल में मिलाकर कफ को कम करने के लिए किया जाता है। हालांकि ऐसा कोई प्रमाण मौजूद नहीं है, जो इस बात का दावा करता हो कि कपूर लगाने से शरीर की चर्बी कम की जा सके। हालांकि खाने योग्य कपूर में स्क्रैपिंग के गुण होते हैं, जो शरीर से अतिरिक्त चर्बी को हटाने का काम करते हैं लेकिन लगाने से चर्बी कम हो, ऐसा कोई प्रमाण नहीं है।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>क्या होता है बेकिंग सोडा?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-baking-soda-p2-1328637\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">बेकिंग सोडा</span></a> का इस्तेमाल खाद्य पदार्थों जैसे ब्रेड, केक आदि में किया जाता है। इसकी प्रकृति क्षारीय (basic) होती है। बेकिंग सोडा एसिड के साथ मिलकर कार्बन डाइऑक्साइड गैस का उत्पादन करता है और ये गैस के बुलबुले खाद्य पदार्थ में फंस जाते हैं, जिससे वह फूल जाता है या ऊपर उठ जाता है लेकिन बेकिंग सोडा का प्रयोग चर्बी कम करने में नहीं किया जाता। विशेषज्ञों का कहना है कि बेकिंग सोडा को विक्स के साथ मिलाकर त्वचा पर लगाना हानिकारक हो सकता है क्योंकि विक्स और बेकिंग सोडा की प्रकृति बिल्कुल अलग है। साथ ही चर्बी कम करने और बेकिंग सोडा को लेकर कोई वैज्ञानिक प्रमाण नहीं है, जो इस दावे की पुष्टि करते हो।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>चर्बी क्या है?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>चर्बी को ओबिसिटी या मोटापा कहा जाता है। <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener

में रखा जाता है। ओबिसिटी को ठीक करने के लिए सही खानपान, शारीरिक गतिविधियों को प्राथमिकता देना एवं तनाव कम लेना शामिल है। इसके अलावा चिकित्सकों की निगरानी में ओबिसिटी को कम करने के लिए सर्जरी भी की जाती है।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>क्या विक्स लगाने से पेट की चर्बी कम होती है?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img

The organism has the ability to invade a high proportion of red blood cells, resulting in severe or life-threatening multi-organ disease. Treatment of malaria usually depends on the correct diagnosis and the completion of the necessary diagnostic tests. Additionally, for severe infections, a combination of antibiotics and traditional anti-malarial therapy can treat malaria. This compilation emphasises the importance of anti-malarial therapy, in addition to antibiotics and preventive measures, in the management of malaria.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-anti-malarial-medications-antibiotics\">Are anti-malarial medications antibiotics?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, anti-malarial medications are not antibiotics. For hundreds of years, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21609473/\">quinine has been the first-line treatment for falciparum malaria</a></span>.

Since many of these antibiotics have been well studied, tolerated, and approved for use in humans, they offer an appealing alternative for the treatment of simple falciparum malaria. The most commonly used antibiotic combination therapy is quinine combined with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11463107/\">tetracycline or doxycycline</a></span>.

Both fever and the back pain could indicate an existing foreign infection or an underlying medical ailment. Furthermore, a rise in body temperature may aggravate pre-existing back pain. However, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28366222/\">fever with low back pain is a strong predictor of spinal infection</a></span>, including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31278933/\">spinal epidural abscesses</a></span>.

Choosing the procedure depends upon the location of the fistula, the length of the fistula and other factors. Unfortunately, both of these procedures don’t have a 100% success rate. Sometimes, the surgery can be unsuccessful and there can be a chance of reoccurrence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-a-better-fistula-treatment-laser-or-open-surgery\">What is a better fistula treatment: laser or open surgery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fistulotomy surgery has been arguably considered the most effective treatment for fistula. However,<a href=\"https://www.thip.media/questions-medical-health/what-are-the-various-types-of-fistula-treatment/38218/\"> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">various other forms of treatment to treat a fistula </span></a>have now started to show their effectiveness. Whether to choose laser or open surgery for fistula is the doctor’s call. It depends upon the age, sex, previous fistula surgery, location of the fistula, and length of the fistula tract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anal-fistula/treatment/\">NHS</a></span>, the fistula is sealed with a small laser beam during the radially emitting laser fibre treatment. Even though there have been no big safety concerns till now, there are still a few uncertainties about how well it works on the patients. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535666/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Laser%20closure%20is%20a,fistulas%20have%20a%20better%20outcome.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Researc</span></a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535666/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20Laser%20closure%20is%20a,fistulas%20have%20a%20better%20outcome.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">h</span></a> states that to treat a transphincteric anal fistula, laser closure is considered to be very effective and safe. The only major prognostic factor while using a laser to close the fistula is the length of the fistula. It is believed that there will be a better outcome if the fistula is short compared to a longer one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does laser or open surgery treat the fistula entirely?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, surgery followed by proper post-operative care cures the problem, but in some instances, there are chances of unsuccessful surgery or reoccurrence of the fistula.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fistula healing depends on age, sex, previous fistula surgery, location of the fistula, and length of the fistula tract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/1107765\">Research published in the JAMA Network</a></span> concluded that it is challenging to treat an anal fistula due to the anatomical location of the fistula. The other challenge is the risk involved in postoperative stool incontinence and septic complications. Even though fistulotomy is the most common procedure opted for removing the fistula, it doesn’t have a 100% success rate, and its success rate ranges between 87% to 94%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, certain fistulas, especially anal fistula, are usually associated with a high risk of recurrence and fecal incontinence. The risk factors for the recurrence of anal fistula after surgery include preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors.

Hence, fever cannot cause involuntary weight loss.</div>\n<p>Unwanted weight loss can have a negative effect on your quality of life. Low body weight and rapid, unintentional weight loss are strongly associated with mortality and morbidity. A variety of physical, psychological, and social conditions, as well as age-related changes, can cause weight loss, but certain patients may have underlying medical conditions. This article will cover the significance, associated symptoms, with an emphasis on fever, and how to manage unwanted weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-when-does-unwanted-weight-loss-become-clinically-significant\">When does unwanted weight loss become clinically significant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unwanted weight loss is commonly regarded as a symptom of a serious disease. And the list of possible causes of weight loss is lengthy. Furthermore, the diseases that cause weight loss have a variety of mechanisms. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7294545/\">Cancer is the most common physical cause of weight loss</a></span>. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7294545/\">Gastrointestinal disease, which includes malabsorption</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7294545/\">inflammatory bowel disease</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7294545/\">severe esophageal dysmotility, and diabetic enteropathy</a></span>, is the second most common physical cause of weight loss. Aside from these, a wide range of conditions have resulted in involuntary weight loss. These include obstructive respiratory diseases, hormonal imbalances, and psychiatric disorders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it possible for fever to cause weight loss?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. Remember that involuntary weight loss is a common and serious symptom of a variety of medical conditions. This is because it reflects the severity of the condition. Weight loss may be associated with fever, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort or pain, diarrhea, or even constipation, depending on what caused the weight loss. While fever is a symptom, it cannot cause involuntary weight loss. Furthermore, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/125/1/012076/pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">both an increase in body temperature and unwanted weight loss aid in the diagnosis of the underlying condition</span></a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/125/1/012076/pdf\">.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When should I seek medical attention for an unintentional weight loss?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Uncontrolled weight loss has the potential to be dangerous. Identifying and treating the underlying medical condition is the first priority in weight loss management. A complete blood count, tests for liver enzyme levels, lactate dehydrogenase level measurement, and radiological examination can all be used to make the diagnosis. So, if you notice any weight-related changes, please consult your doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that determining the underlying cause of unwanted weight loss can be difficult at times. This is due to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7294545/\">three critical considerations</a></span>. First, not all patients with weight loss have serious physical illnesses, so an extensive clinical evaluation could fail to detect disease in some cases. Second, many patients who claim to have lost weight have actually gained weight. Third, there may be a lack of data on the underlying cause of weight loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from medical treatment, you need <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2131340/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">access to good nutrition frequently</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">for nutrition-deficit weight loss</span></a>. Also, you need a number of important strategies that do not involve medication to prevent or treat malnutrition and increase food intake. You can also take <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2131340/\">prescribed supplements</a></span> by your doctor in addition to your regular food intake.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is fever capable of causing weight loss?

Yellow fever was a mysterious condition that primarily affected tropical regions in Africa, the Caribbean, and America from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The disease, however, is frequently confused with malaria. Therefore, this article summarizes the clinical features, similarities, and differences between the two conditions, as well as the management of yellow fever.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-the-clinical-features-of-yellow-fever\">What are the clinical features of yellow fever?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613873/\">Yellow fever has three distinct stages</a></span>. These are the infection phase, the remission phase, and the intoxication phase. Feeling uneasy, headaches, body aches, weakness, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, irritability, and dizziness characterise the infection period. Symptoms usually subside during the second stage. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613873/\">Around 20 to 50% of patients progress to phase 3</a></span>, which is characterized by the recurrence of signs and symptoms such as high fever, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, oliguria, hemorrhagic diathesis, and a possible organ failure. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613873/\">It has been observed that those who enter Phase 3 usually do not survive</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is malaria different from yellow fever?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yellow fever and malaria are two distinct conditions. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12806465/\">Yellow fever is a viral and non-contagious disease</a></span> caused by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5613873/\">the yellow fever virus, an arbovirus</a></span>. Malaria, on the other hand, is parasitic in nature. Yellow fever mosquitoes are found in Africa and in South America&#8217;s tropics and subtropics. Mosquitoes become infectious carriers when they bite virus-infected primates. It should be noted that the mosquitoes that cause malaria are not the same as those that transmit yellow fever. Furthermore, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20671663/\">yellow fever has a preventive vaccine</a></span>, whereas <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine\">malaria vaccine trials are still ongoing</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are yellow fever and malaria related?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow fever and malaria share a few characteristics. To begin with, they are both spread by mosquitoes. Second, they have a fever and other flu-like symptoms. Finally, they can both cause jaundice, severe illness, and even death.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the treatment for yellow fever?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25453327/\">travel history to Africa or South America</a></span> is important in determining the presence of yellow fever.

It can happen between two organs or vessels in the body. They can occur in various areas of the body. However, the most common ones are anal, urinary tract and gastrointestinal fistulas. The first line of treatment is through medications, such as antibiotics and if that fails then a fistula surgery is needed. Whether a fistula needs an operation or not is entirely dependent on the condition of a patient. There are <a href=\"https://www.thip.media/questions-medical-health/what-are-the-various-types-of-fistula-treatment/38218/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">various types of fistula treatment options available. </span></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-i-avoid-a-fistula-operation\">Can I avoid a fistula operation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not necessarily. There are various types of fistulas, most of which require surgical intervention. Some fistulas can be treated only with antibiotics and other medications. In cases when these interventions don’t work, <a href=\"https://www.thip.media/questions-medical-health/can-laser-treatment-or-open-surgery-cure-a-fistula-completely/38157/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">surgical removal of fistula may be necessary</span></a>.  One cannot determine if antibiotics or other medications can treat the fistula until the location (anal or urinary tract or gastrointestinal, etc.) and severity is determined by a healthcare expert.

Various types of surgical procedures are there and the position of the fistulas and whether it&#8217;s a single channel or branches off in different directions will determine the type of surgery needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anal-fistula\">Hopkins Medicine</a></span>, once a person gets an anal fistula, antibiotics alone will not cure it and surgery is needed to treat it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few options other than surgery include using a medical plug, placing a thin surgical cord called a seton to drain the infection and heal it, using a medical glue and opening up the fistula with an incision along its length to allow it to heal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How serious is a fistula operation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fistulas can cause a lot of discomfort and, if left untreated, may cause serious complications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For small fistulas, the doctor may perform an in-office procedure. A procedure called fistulotomy is done to open and drain the fistula. The doctor may apply stitches to seal the fistula, allowing it to heal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger fistulas will require proper surgery to close them properly. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics and painkillers to prevent infections. Also, in the case of anal fistulas, even stool softeners might be prescribed to make bowel movements easier while healing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small fistulas may take just a few days or weeks to heal. However, larger fistulas can take a longer time to heal and may even require additional surgeries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surgery, like any other surgery, comes with certain complications, which may be general or specific. The general complications include pain, bleeding, infection, allergic reaction and scarring.

It is important to note that skin aging can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic aging is a slow and natural process. Extrinsic aging, on the other hand, refers to premature aging that is accelerated by environmental factors such as excessive sunlight exposure, pollutants, toxins, stress, and lifestyle-related factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is a banana-coffee paste good for skin tightening?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, to a certain extent. This is due to the fact that both bananas and coffee have some skin benefits. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21369778/\">Bananas are high in antioxidants, which aid in the fight against free radicals in the body</a></span>. Thus, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23964457/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">applying bananas to the skin may help protect it from free radical damage</span></a>. Additionally. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21369778/\">Banana phenols</a></span> are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of acne scars and skin tightening. However, this anti-acne action may not be effective. Furthermore, bananas may promote healthier skin. Please keep in mind that bananas should be avoided if users develop rashes, itchy skin, facial swellings, or any other allergic reaction to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caffeine, on the other hand, is present in coffee. Coffee <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23075568/\">polyphenol compounds have antioxidant effects</a></span>. Since they neutralize free radicals, they could be used as anti-wrinkle and anti-aging agents. This antioxidant property slows the photoaging process of the skin. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that adding caffeine to the formula of sunscreen cosmetics increases their <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17388926/\">UV radiation protection, reduces the formation of free radicals in skin cells, and could be useful in preventing UV-induced skin cancers</a></span>. Caffeine is a biologically active compound due to all of its characteristics. However, there is little data on the precise dosage and delivery systems of the two ingredients for skin tightening. As a result, both ingredients require additional research.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is it risky to treat skin laxity and wrinkles solely with natural remedies?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it would be a risk for now. Despite the fact that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20509719/\">botanical extracts are becoming increasingly popular for skin protection against erythema, premature aging, and cancer caused by irradiation</a></span>, many more controlled clinical trials are required to assess the effectiveness and uncertainties of plant-derived products in dermatology. Furthermore, safety concerns, particularly sensitization and photodermatitis, require attention. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20509719/\">Green and black tea, carotenoids, coffee, and many flavonoids found in fruits and vegetables</a></span> are among the most popular natural options. However, the most widely accepted skin tightening therapies include prescribed topical retinal and collagen applications, non-invasive laser skin procedures, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23135076/\">light source and radiofrequency treatments</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21904971/\">surgical facelift procedures</a></span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30869754/\">Ultherapy</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>THIP MEDIA TAKE: We conclude that banana and coffee paste may be beneficial and safer for the skin.

In most cases, the ovaries are removed during the uterus removal surgery. However, if a woman&#8217;s ovaries are not removed during surgery before her menopause,&nbsp;the ovaries might still make hormones and eggs until the woman reaches menopause naturally. If the ovaries are removed at the time of hysterectomy but the woman didn&#8217;t reach menopause, she&#8217;ll have menopause immediately after surgery. You might experience menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How serious is uterus removal surgery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Uterus Removal Surgery or Hysterectomy is major surgery. One might need hospitalization for five days after surgery. Also, it might take around 6 to 8 weeks to recover fully. Recovery times can also vary depending on the type of hysterectomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the surgery is very safe, but with any major surgery comes the risk of complications. Risks associated with an abdominal hysterectomy include blood clots, infection, etc. <a href=\"https://www.thip.media/questions-medical-health/what-are-the-long-term-effects-of-a-hysterectomy/38102/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The long-term effects of a hysterectomy</span></a> are variable.

However, it is also done to improve a woman&#8217;s life. If the only treatment option is a hysterectomy, you must not avoid it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some instances, other procedures after proper evaluation can be done to treat the condition. The alternatives as per the condition include polypectomy (a procedure to remove a polyp), myomectomy (a procedure to remove fibroids), or endometrial ablation to avoid hysterectomy.

According to studies, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23559932/\">TB patients have a high prevalence of periodontitis</a></span>. This is because the oral cavity contains the body&#8217;s second largest and most diverse microbial community, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23559942/\"><em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, the causative organism of tuberculosis found in patients&#8217; plaque and saliva</a></span>, has the potential to disrupt the natural flora (bacteria and other microorganisms present) of the mouth, eventually contributing to advanced gum tissue destruction.

Therefore, TB is a contributing factor in the development of gum disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can periodontal treatment help with overall tuberculosis management?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, to a certain extent. Gum diseases frequently cause changes to the oral flora (bacteria and other microorganisms present in the mouth).

The available evidence suggests diabetes cause migraine. Frequent migraine attacks are a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27617234/\">symptom of diabetes</a></span>. Often headaches are not harmful. People should consider a health checkup when frequent headaches are followed by diabetes symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undiagnosed diabetes can cause migraine. Also, people with diabetes can have migraine. In this case, the increased frequency can suspect a person of changing blood sugar levels. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056164/\">Research published in 2018</a></span> informs that there is no significant difference in the occurrence of migraine between diabetic and non-diabetic people. However, diabetic people are at a higher risk of migraine attacks. There are no evidence confirming that frequent migraine attacks induce diabetes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why does diabetes cause migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>High blood sugar causes headaches. Frequent headaches can be a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17594328/\">symptom of hyperglycemia</a></span>. This health condition is a technical term for high glucose in the blood that happens when the body cannot use insulin properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, migraine can be an early sign of hyperglycemia.

Many types of prostheses allow the same range of movements as the typical joint. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6667980/#:~:text=Kneeling%20is%20important%20for%20many,for%20most%20patients%20with%20TKR.&amp;text=In%20one%20study%20with%20patients,were%20able%20to%20kneel%20easily.\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Research</span> </a>suggests that kneeling can be the most difficult activity to do for a patient with TKR even though it is one of the most important one. Also, it has the poorest patient-rated outcome after the surgery. Between 50% and 80% of patients report that they have difficulty kneeling or do not kneel in the months and years after TKR.&nbsp; A total knee motion after the surgery is unlikely, although there is an improvement. It must be noted that not every patient faces difficulty in kneeling after surgery. If a&nbsp;patient undergoes a total knee replacement because of arthritis, one would be unable to do things he/she couldn&#8217;t do before the surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-you-drive-a-car-after-knee-replacement-surgery\">Can you drive a car after knee replacement surgery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. You can drive after your knee is recovered enough to get in and out of a car and control the car properly after the knee replacement surgery. It might take about 6-8 weeks after the surgery to recover in order to be safe to drive. Before driving, the patient must consider that certain things would be different with the new knee, such as getting in and out of the car, how the leg is comfortable, etc. You must consult their physiotherapist or doctor to confirm whether driving is appropriate.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can a person walk or kneel after a knee replacement surgery?

This condition is called hypotension. A variety of factors ranging from dehydration to severe medical conditions can cause hypotension. Therefore, determining the cause of low blood pressure is essential for its treatment. Fever may also cause low blood pressure. This compilation discusses the primary causes, as well as the possibility of fever causing hypotension, signs, and symptoms, and the management of low blood pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-are-the-most-common-causes-of-low-blood-pressure\">What are the most common causes of low blood pressure?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Low blood pressure occurs when blood flow to the body&#8217;s organs is insufficient. The signs and symptoms of hypotension differ depending on the cause. Light headedness, dizziness, or even fainting are common symptoms in such cases. Other common causes of low blood pressure include decreased blood volume, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27182849/\">cardiac conditions</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17486524/\">pregnancy</a></span>, malnutrition, dehydration, and severe allergic reactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In severe cases, low blood pressure can reduce blood flow to the body&#8217;s organs, resulting in strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29546535/\">shock</a></span>. Thus, you should check your blood pressure on a regular basis with the help of a doctor. If it is low, the cause should be determined. Blood tests, radiological studies, and cardiac testing can help determine the underlying cause of low blood pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it possible for a fever to cause low blood pressure?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330579822_Hypotension\">fever above 101 degrees Fahrenheit</a></span> as a result of a severe infection or medical condition may cause hypotension. This happens because <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330579822_Hypotension\">severe diseases reduce stroke volume and heart rate</a></span>, resulting in a decrease in total cardiac output. This ultimately reduces the heart&#8217;s ability to produce blood pressure. As a result, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330579822_Hypotension\">low blood pressure could be a medical emergency</a></span> if combined with chest pains, vomiting, dehydration, headache, and shortness of breath. This will require immediate medical attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I treat hypotension at home?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Home remedies, while effective in preventing symptoms, are not a cure-all. Proper hydration, avoiding alcohol, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21680629/\">avoiding prolonged sitting</a></span>, eating a healthy diet, and exercising on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to make any special preparations for a blood pressure check-up. Please consult a doctor if you experience any of the symptoms of low blood pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How is hypotension treated medically?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Asymptomatic low blood pressure is rarely a cause for concern. However, if your symptoms are severe or are leading to other serious medical conditions, you may need medical attention. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330579822_Hypotension\">cause determines the treatment of low blood pressure</a></span>. Furthermore, low blood pressure requires emergency medical attention when there is a trauma resulting in external or possible internal bleeding. Also, low blood pressure can also be a result of exposure to an allergen, severe dehydration, or an infection. Ignoring these conditions may result in a lack of oxygen to the brain and other organs. And this can be fatal. So, you have to seek immediate medical attention.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is a fever capable of causing hypotension?

It is done for various reasons, such as removing tumours, cancer, fibroid, uterine prolapse, endometriosis, adenomyosis (thickening of the uterus), etc. In some cases, there can be some effects of hysterectomy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, the woman recovers completely after the hysterectomy.

However, there can be certain effects of hysterectomy like residual pain in some cases, even after a few months. If you experience such pain, you should consult the doctor. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19590472/\">Research</a></span> states that in rare cases, the patient may experience persistence even after a few months post-surgery.

A hysterectomy may not alter a woman’s personality. However, there may be certain behavioural changes in a few women which can be observed due to the change in hormonal production.

However, <em>Garbha Vridhi</em> is described as a complication. <em>Garbha</em> describes a condition with excessive increase in size of abdomen, perspiration and difficulty in labour. <em>Ayurveda</em> observes obesity as closely linked to insulin resistance. The description of diabetes comes under Prameha where it discusses its different types and detailed management including <em>Ahara</em>, <em>Vihara</em> and <em>Aushadha Chikitsa</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-does-ayurveda-treat-gestational-diabetes\">How does Ayurveda treat gestational diabetes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Ayurveda, there is a multidisciplinary approach, which includes preventive measures and other practices such as Yogasana and Pranayam along with dietary management and consumption of certain herbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preventive measures involve keeping the pregnant woman in a healthy state of body and mind. <em>Garbhadhan Vidhi Acharyas</em> advise body purifying measures (Sanshodhana Karma) along with special diet and mode of life. Individualised month wise diet regime is also prescribed for a pregnant woman to keep her and her baby in good health, energy, and compactness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yogasana is advised, and it should not be practiced empty stomach. The pregnant mother must consume a light diet one hour before. Certain asanas contraindicate which involves lying down on abdomen or involves twists and turns. Women with a threatened abortion, or a history of recurrent abortions should also not do Yogasana. The commonly recommended schedule is to practice yoga from 18 to 32 week of gestation, 1-hour session of yoga at least thrice a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under herbs, various plants have been used individually or in formulations to treat diabetes and its complications. The most common herbs include turmeric, Neem, Indian Gooseberry, bitter gourd, Bilva (Indian Bael), cinnamon, fenugreek and garlic. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://sciforum.net/paper/view/10972\">Ayurvedic researchers</a></span> state that phytochemicals from Tinospora cordifolia have proved effective against gestational diabetes mellitus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, diet plays a major role in managing gestational diabetes as per Ayurveda. Vegetables such as&nbsp; pinach, cucumber, radish, sponge gourd, karela (bitter gourd), tomatoes, drumstick, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage are recommended. You should consume pulses like green gram, chickpea, bengal gram, etc. You should also include spices such as cinnamon, fenugreek seeds, garlic, turmeric, etc. in your diet. Also, eat dry fruits and fruits with a low glycemic index, like apples, peaches, etc. in moderate quantities.&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can gestational diabetes be cured with Ayurveda?

The recovery timeline for a total knee replacement typically lasts 12 weeks. As suggested by the doctor, one must perform rehabilitation exercises to help improve recovery time.

Most of the patients must be able to bend/flex their knee to at least 70- 90 degrees in the initial days post-surgery. If the patient exercises and follows the post-operative instructions of the doctor and achieves 90 degrees in one week, then they will end up with an excellent range of motion after the surgery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, with exercise and rehab, bending and strength of the knee would improve, and you may go off the assisted device at around 4-6 weeks post-surgery.

Furthermore, eating a healthy diet before and during pregnancy has been associated with a lower risk of pregnancy complications such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937821027289#bib2\">gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, obesity-related complications, and, in some populations, preeclampsia and gestational hypertension</a></span>.

Thus, women should consume a diet high in protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins while pregnant to benefit both foetal development and the child after birth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can a mother&#8217;s diet during pregnancy influence her child&#8217;s skin color?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, there is no concrete evidence. Human skin is available in a variety of tones and colors. There are numerous factors that influence skin color, but <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\">genetics determines constitutive skin color</a></span>. The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">enzyme tyrosi</span></a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">nase</span></a> is primarily responsible for the genetic mechanism that controls human skin color. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\">Melanin, the primary determinant of human skin color, is produced in the skin by melanocytes</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\">.</a> Thus, it should be noted that the genes that determine skin color are controlled by melanin quantity and quality. This genetic mechanism is reinforced by facultative melanogenesis and tanning reactions. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515229/\">Vitamin D</a></span>, like melanin, has been shown to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues, including the skin, which may influence skin color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/976976/\">the infant&#8217;s skin color varies between 25 and 44 weeks of gestation</a></span>, the dark red color of premature infants is due to blood and vasculature visible through thin, translucent skin, which changes to pink under genetic influence, resulting in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8026818/\">decreased pigmentation in 37 to 42 weeks</a></span>. Besides that, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600644/#R26\">functional maturation of the skin during neonatal and early childhood continues until the second year of life</a></span>. Nonetheless, our research found no evidence that the maternal diet influences this skin color variation of the infant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the impact of the mother&#8217;s diet on the child&#8217;s complexion, Nidhi Sarin explained that, while some people believe that eating coconut in the morning will give your baby a fair or light complexion, it is a myth that a mother&#8217;s food&nbsp;improves a baby&#8217;s complexion because it is entirely dependent on genetics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why is newborn skin health so important?</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth noting that newborn infants rely on their skin for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600644/\">structural integrity, mechanical trauma resistance, thermal regulation, and sensory transduction</a>.</span> Since newborn skin is more fragile, more susceptible to infections, has a high risk of heat loss, and a high permeability to toxic topical agents, thus, newborns, particularly pre-term babies, require special skincare to protect them from chemical and thermal damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE:</strong> We conclude that fetal skin color is mainly determined by genetic factors. Furthermore, maternal nutrition affects the baby&#8217;s growth and development, including skin health. However, it has no effect on the baby&#8217;s skin color.

मानिसहरूले पाइल्सको उपचार गर्न यसमै मात्र भर पर्नु हुँदैन ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>आकाशबेली एक परजीवी बिरुवा भएकोले यसलाई कुनैपनि आधिकारिक र पेशेवर व्यक्तिको अनुमति बिना प्रयोग गर्नु हुँदैन । हामीले फेला

It causes mild, cold-like symptoms infecting the nose, throat, lungs, and breathing passages. Generally, most people recover within a week or two. However, in cases of infants or older adults, RSV can be serious. This seasonal lung infection is highly contagious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CDC</span></a>, it is the most common cause of pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) in children younger than one year of age in the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It spreads either through direct contacts, such as coming in contact with respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, or kissing) from an infected person or indirect contact, such as touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Are COVID vaccines responsible for increasing cases of RSV?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. There&#8217;s no conclusive evidence that proves or shows that Covid vaccination makes people more susceptible to RSV. If this were true that Covid vaccination puts people at higher risk of RSV, then this impact would have been seen a long time ago on all age groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/159611/download\"> </a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/159611/download\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">FDA document </span></a>which is being referred to in the post refers to a minuscule number. The RSV infection was reported in 0.4%. In fact, as per the data, 0.1 per cent of placebo recipients who didn&#8217;t receive the vaccine also were infected with RSV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It further states, &#8220;There is not a clear biological mechanism that would explain a causal association for certain respiratory infections but not others. Overall, the frequency and clinical course for these events do not appear unusual given the age group of the study population and the season (fall-winter) during which the study took place, and the observed imbalance could be due to chance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It must also be noted that the highest number of cases of RSV are seen in infants and children and till now, whereas there is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0618-children-vaccine.html\">no COVID-19 vaccine authorized for children younger than 6 months old</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the immune system is highly specific to millions of antigens. If a person is gaining immunity to one virus, it doesn&#8217;t mean that immunity to other viruses would be reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/rsv-pandemic-virus-explainer/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">T</span></a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/rsv-pandemic-virus-explainer/\">he World Economic Forum</a> </span>states that the reason for the increase in RSV cases is that many children were shielded from common infections during lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00479.asp\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">According to the CDC</span></a>, children are at a higher risk for infection as, due to lockdowns, their immune systems weren’t exposed to the virus as much over the last few years.

These events could be caused by either human or program errors. Regardless, vaccine-related adverse events can affect healthy people and should be reported as soon as possible to allow for additional research and appropriate action. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/regulation-prequalification/regulation-and-safety/pharmacovigilance/health-professionals-info/aefi\">WHO has established a Global Vaccine Safety Response Team</a></span> to respond to vaccine safety issues in a timely, efficient, and scientifically rigorous manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE</strong>: We conclude that a vaccine program is essential for the underprivileged, particularly in developing countries.

To this, she said, &#8220;Magnetic acupressure therapy, in general, cannot produce insulin in pancreas. So, this question should not arise because a ring cannot control and maintain blood sugar. Only walking 40 to 60mnt/day, doing exercise, yoga and eating food that has low glycemic index can maintain blood sugar. A holistic and disciplined way of life can ensure regulation of blood sugar in ones body.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Ms Lal negates the effect of ring on blood sugar levels, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388088/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">research paper published in 2017</span></a> proves the claim. This paper shows that a ring is a patented device that provide acupressure at a point. However, the paper does not clearly explain how a ring uses magnetic acupressure therapy to normalize blood sugar levels. This therapy needs to be explored further ahead. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What can be the dangers of trying to maintain blood sugar levels at home and not seek medical advice?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question, we referred to a warning issued on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/beware-illegally-marketed-diabetes-treatments#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPeople%20with%20chronic,blindness%2C%20and%20death.%E2%80%9D\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">website</span></a>. The website informs that products that ensure an easy fix can be alluring, but people can take a risk and gamble with their health. The warning states ‘People with chronic or incurable diseases may feel desperate and become easy targets’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying solely on an easy fix and not following well-established treatment plans can cause unforeseen health issues. Blindly using bogus products can worsen health conditions and expose people to unproven and unreasonable risky products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fake claims of jewelry pieces curing health conditions are common on social media.

Fluoride is a trace element that is necessary, but too much of it can be harmful. Thus, excessive sodium fluoride (NaF) consumption through food, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34173906/\">water</a>,</span> toothpaste, and other sources may have negative effects on the human body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be noted that prolonged exposure <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36079765/\">could harm body tissues, especially the nervous system</a></span>. Fluoride administration to pregnant women on a regular basis can have negative consequences for their babies. This is due to fluoride&#8217;s ability to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33096359/\">cross the placenta and the fetus&#8217; blood-brain barrier</a></span> and impair<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33096359/\"> brain development</a></span> by altering brain tissue morphology, neuron ultrastructure, and neurotransmitter content. Furthermore, excessive fluoride can impair brain function, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19102839/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">lowering children&#8217;s Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</span></a>, cognition, memory, and locomotor behavior. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19162352/Dr-Abhishek-Juneja.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Abhishek Juneja\" class=\"wp-image-35208\" srcset=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19162352/Dr-Abhishek-Juneja.jpg 200w, https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19162352/Dr-Abhishek-Juneja-150x144.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When we asked <strong>Neurologist Dr. Abhishek Juneja</strong>, if fluoride could harm the central nervous system, he said that, &#8220;Fluoride toxicity is known to cause neurodevelopmental side effects in developing brains, including cognitive dysfunction. This is due to the accumulation of this neurotoxin in certain areas of the brain. Thus, a diet high in antioxidants aids in the detoxification of such body tissues.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is turmeric capable of removing fluorides from the brain?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, there is no substantial evidence to prove that. Curcumin is a yellow pigment derived from turmeric that has anti-carcinogenic, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29607689/\">antioxidant</a></span>, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Many <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21901432/\">significant studies</a></span> have been mentioned as a result of these characteristics. One such study on rats found that curcumin treatment for prolonged <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24696547/\">fluoride exposure benefits the brain, behavior patterns, and cognition</a></span>. And the other rat study validated its <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502194/\">neuroprotective ability</a></span> against <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502194/\">sodium-fluoride-induced</a></span> brain stress. As a result, the majority of these studies support its <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29607689/\">neuroprotective potential</a></span>. Regardless, more research is required. Hence, the role of curcumin in reversing fluoride toxicities is unclear. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How can excessive fluoride exposure be avoided?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please keep in mind that there is no definitive cure for the negative effects of fluoride exposure. These conditions include both <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32207100/\">skeletal</a></span> and dental fluorosis. However, limiting fluoride intake could effectively prevent the condition. Among them are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32207100/\">drinking safe water</a></span>, promoting nutrition, and avoiding fluoride-rich foods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIP MEDIA TAKE:</strong> Although turmeric is considered an effective nutritional supplement with various disease-preventing characteristics, the mechanism of its functionality is less likely to be precise. Moreover, the evidence to date does not support the possibility of turmeric eliminating fluoride from the brain.

This is because patients with thalassemia are preoccupied with the serious medical complications of the condition. Regrettably, dental health suffers in such cases. As a result, they <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11788807/\">seek emergency dental care</a></span> for severe tooth pain caused by chronic abscesses and tooth infections. Thus, such patients are more likely to have their teeth extracted or removed rather than filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are dental problems managed in a thalassemia patient?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dental management of thalassemia patients requires a multidisciplinary approach. Ideally, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407235/#b20-epj-09-4003\">the general dentist and the orthodontist should collaborate with the hematologist</a></span>. In thalassemia patients, any invasive dental procedure should be performed under antibiotic cover and immediately after transfusion. Such patients should also have liver function and blood clotting tests before undergoing dental procedures. Less severe cases may be treated surgically as well as orthodontically, whereas less severe misalignments should only be treated orthodontically. The doctors may employ sedation or anesthesia during the dental treatment of the patients to improve control and cooperation. There must be careful monitoring of the patients due to complications related to their compromised immunity.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the impact of thalassemia on dental health?

If a person suffers from migraine, whether to take part in sports or not is a question that gives conflicting opinions. Few believe that it will make your symptoms worse, and for some it will be beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-why-should-people-with-migraine-participate-in-sports\">Why should people with migraine participate in sports?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159460/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159460/\">role of exercise in migraine</a></span> is still unclear. Few studies indicate a protective role of sports in migraine. However, further studies are needed to find the association between sports and migraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an association between exercising regularly and reducing the frequency and intensity of migraines. Also, exercise stimulates the release of hormones such as endorphins and enkephalins. These hormones work as the body’s natural painkillers and natural antidepressants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, exercising can help people prevent attacks by relieving stress, which is a common migraine trigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35852657/\">Research</a></span> supports the role of aerobic exercise in migraine prevention and treatment as exertion reduces pain intensity, frequency, duration of attacks, and medication use. Also, lower cardiovascular fitness levels increase the lifetime risk of developing migraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why do people with migraine are advised to refrain from sports?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16483514/\">Sport and exercise-induced migraines</a></span> are difficult to distinguish from benign exertional headaches and other headache syndromes. The migraine trigger can solely be exertion which can be due to active sports, or there might be multiple triggers for a person’s headache.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though participating in active sports has several positive effects, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35852657/\">exercise could be harmful</a></span> due to predisposing factors such as the dysfunction of the exercise-induced analgesia, together with other exercise-related factors (short warm-up, incorrect rest phases, excessive training) and other common migraine triggers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, one should not exercise if a person is in the middle of a migraine attack, as there is a possibility that it can worsen the pain. Vigorous exercise might be a trigger in a few people with migraine, but overall, the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risk for people with migraine.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can I play heavy sports with migraine?

This occurs because the tension caused by teeth clenching can cause a dull headache, which can aggravate migraine pain. </div>\n<p>Clenching or Bruxism in medical terms, is a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/parafunctional-activity\">parafunctional activity</a></span> just like bracing, gnashing, and grinding. It is a &#8220;parafunctional habit&#8221; and is associated with life stress that may be caused by familial responsibilities or work pressure. This unintentional habit can be extremely harmful to the teeth and surrounding tissues. People with untreated bruxism grind their teeth down and break them. This typically causes jaw aches and, eventually, misalignment. Hence, this article compiles the causes of migraine, the role of clenching in migraine development, and the management of the condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-factors-contribute-to-clenching-teeth\">What factors contribute to clenching teeth?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Teeth grinding is frequently associated with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557915/\">sleep apnea and other sleep disorders</a></span>. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557915/\">Sleep apnea</a></span> is a condition in which one briefly stops breathing while sleeping. People who snore or wake up gasping for air are likely to be affected. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557915/\">Stress, anger, and anxiety</a></span> are frequent contributors to this behavior. Thus, even while sleeping, the restless mind causes problems. Additionally, some medications and substances can cause this behavior. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557915/\">Antidepressants, caffeine, and alcohol</a></span> are among the most common. Bruxism can be caused by a variety of medical conditions. The most common conditions are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18557915/\">Parkinson&#8217;s disease, dementia, and epilepsy</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is clenching involved in migraine development?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The habit of grinding one&#8217;s teeth could intensify migraine attacks. The actions involved in a teeth-clenching episode are physically exhausting. Muscles, tendons, and joints all appear to be overworked. The tension frequently manifests as dull headaches, particularly in the temples, that do not go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is due to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23424716/\">temporomandibular joint&#8217;s (TMJ) involvement</a></span>. The TMJ is protected by powerful muscles that control the jaw. These muscles are also responsible for connecting the skull to the jaw. When someone who suffers from bruxism clenches or grinds their teeth, the tension that is created spreads out and up into the head and neck. This <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23424716/\">tension causes a headache as well as sore muscles in the face, head, neck, and shoulders</a></span>. In migraine sufferers, this induced dull headache pain may aggravate migraine attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How should the condition be addressed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to understand that by the time most people realize they have a problem of teeth grinding the damage has already been done. As a result, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29926505/\">regular dental exams with a dentist will help detect bruxism</a></span>. After determining the condition, the dental expert may recommend <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17943862/\">splints</a></span> and mouth guards in addition to dental corrections. Furthermore, the dentist could teach jaw exercises to help retrain the jaw to move and bite properly. The teeth grinders must <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29926505/\">develop stress, anxiety, and anger management strategies</a></span>. People who have sleep apnea-induced clenching must see a specialist to address the problem.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can teeth grinding lead to migraine?

As a person ages, the skin becomes thinner and less elastic over time. However, certain other factors such as sun exposure, smoking, dehydration, some medications and environmental and genetic factors also play a vital role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blemishes and wrinkles are signs of skin ageing. Both signs occur due to<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3583892/#:~:text=the%20passing%20time.-,Skin%20aging,-is%20a%20complex\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3583892/#:~:text=the%20passing%20time.-,Skin%20aging,-is%20a%20complex\">irreversible structural and biological changes</a></span> in the layers of the skin. However medical treatments under the guidance of experienced doctors can reduce the appearance of blemishes, wrinkles and other visible signs of ageing.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/16181152/jyooti.jpg\" alt=\"Dermatalogist Dr. Kannagath\" class=\"wp-image-30695\" srcset=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/16181152/jyooti.jpg 200w, https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/16181152/jyooti-150x150.jpg 150w, https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/16181152/jyooti-96x96.jpg 96w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our Dermatology expert, Dr. Jyothy Kannangath</strong>, describes the etiology behind wrinkles by stating, “Wrinkles occur as people age or due to repeated muscle contractions. As we age, the skin cells divide more slowly, and the middle layer of your skin, the dermis, begins to thin. The dermis has a network of elastin and collagen fibres, which offer support and elasticity. As this network loosens and becomes weak, depressions form on your skin’s surface. Aging skin is also less able to retain moisture, less efficient in secreting oil and slower to heal. All of these factors contribute to the development of wrinkles.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can a mixture of egg white, milk and apple help eliminate wrinkles and age lines?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. Many factors affect the elasticity of the skin, such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10709362/\">sun exposure</a></span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146365/\">diet</a></span>. Getting wrinkles and age lines is<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556106/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556106/\">a natural process</a></span> and reversing it or eliminating it through an external application is not possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, on researching, we could not find any credible scientific evidence that proves that a mixture of egg white, milk and apple helps eliminate wrinkles and age lines. However, some studies on individual ingredients of this mixture that indicate anti-aging properties. However, one needs further research to prove this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eggs contain vitamin A, and applying vitamin A to the skin may promote wound healing and reduce wrinkles.&nbsp; A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5072512/\">study</a></span> that evaluated the effects of water-soluble egg membranes (WSEM) on wrinkle reduction concluded that applying WSEM can significantly reduce wrinkle depth by protection from free radical damage at the cellular level and induction of several antioxidant response elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there can be certain disadvantages of using eggs on the face for a few people. It can lead to skin irritation. Some people might have an allergic reaction and can experience specific symptoms such as severe itchiness, rash, hives, and breathing difficulties from using egg whites on their face depending on the severity of the disease. Similarly, if you have any recent cuts, scrapes, or wounds, the use of raw egg whites could potentially cause a secondary infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, apple is speculated to have anti-aging properties due to the presence of essential fatty acids that keeps the skin moist and plump. It is considered to minimize fine lines and wrinkles due to vitamins E and C.&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424007/\">Research on</a></span> anti-aging facial serum containing apple stem cell extract showed significant improvement in aging skin signs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, milk is also considered to have anti-aging properties. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34071375/\">Milk is considered to improve the skin&#8217;s condition</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34071375/\"> </a>through various means, including antiaging effects. Furthermore, the<a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8197926/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8197926/\">amino acids also have positive effects</a></span> on the skin, such as proline has antiaging properties, which reduce wrinkles and sagging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, further studies are needed to prove the efficiency of the application of these agents on the skin concerning the reduction or elimination of wrinkles and age lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Kannangath </strong>further clarifies this by stating, “Egg white, apple and milk are used as face masks which claim to tighten the skin. However, there is no scientific evidence to prove that this mask can reduce wrinkle formation, as skin ageing is an internal process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, before applying egg whites to your face, do a patch test as it can cause an allergic reaction. This test involves applying a small amount of egg white to the back of the hand, under the chin, or behind the ear to see if it causes any allergic reaction.”</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can wrinkles and age lines be treated with egg white, milk and apple?

This is because oral lesions of tuberculosis are thought to account for 0.1–5% of all tuberculosis infections. Since these oral indications could emerge as a result of drug-resistant tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and even HIV-associated opportunistic infections. As a result, the objective of this review is to improve understanding of the oral problems indicating tuberculosis as well as the role of a dentist in its detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-could-oral-issues-indicate-tuberculosis\">Could oral issues indicate tuberculosis?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, dental identification of M. tuberculosis has the potential to be a valuable tool in the first line of defense against this dangerous, and often fatal, disease. It is worth noting that oral tuberculosis (Oral TB) does occur, but it is uncommon. These lesions could be either primary or secondary in nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15641968/\">Primary lesions</a></span> are rare and most commonly seen in younger patients with enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Secondary oral tuberculosis usually occurs in conjunction with pulmonary disease and can affect people of all ages. However, people in their forties and fifties are more susceptible. The most likely route of inoculation is for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25654056/\">organisms to enter the sputum</a></span> and reach the mucosal tissue through a small break in the surface. Furthermore, the organisms may enter the oral tissues <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25654056/\">via the bloodstream causing ulceration of the oral mucosa</a></span>. Oral TB lesions can take many forms. These lesions specifically include <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/273672/\">ulcers</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25675696/\">nodules</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25675696/\">, </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25675696/\">and periapical granulomas</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25675696/\">.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which oral sites are usually affected by tuberculosis?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oral tubercular lesions can affect any part of the oral mucosa. However, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17486190/\">tongue is the most commonly</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17486190/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17486190/\">affected</a></span>. &nbsp;Other sites include the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11529411/\">palate</a></span>, lips, buccal mucosa, gums, and floor of the mouth. The salivary glands, tonsils, and uvula are frequently involved. In contrast, the retromolar and lower arch alveolar mucosal regions are rarely involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is it possible for a dentist to identify the condition?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Although rare, oral tuberculosis provides an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22014940/\">early window for tuberculosis detection</a></span>. Thus, by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32461909/\">correlating the history, clinical, and radiological examinations, a dental expert can assist in identifying the condition</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32461909/\">.</a> Despite the fact that microbial culture is considered absolute proof of disease,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25654056/\">laboratory confirmation</a></span>, and a thorough <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25654056/\">histopathological examination</a></span> are required for a correct diagnosis. Furthermore, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25654056/\">cultures, mycobacterial growth indicator tubes, and BACTEC</a></span> are regarded as the most effective tools for TB detection.

Recently, there has been evidence referring to the association between sleep and the immune system and how sleep disruptions could upset the delicate balance, with serious consequences for health outcomes. Thus, this write-up discusses the importance of sleep health and the effects of sleep deprivation on fever due to infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What impact does sleep have on the immune system?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need sleep for the maintenance of vital functions. It also appears to be important in disease defense. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417606/\">Sleep deprivation has been shown to suppress the host&#8217;s immune response</a></span> to external pathogens such as viruses. As a result, you should maintain a consistent sleep schedule. A strong immune system ensures that immune responses are appropriate and effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159089/\">population-based studies</a></span> show that chronic sleep deprivation raises the risk of mortality and promotes pathological conditions <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159089/\">characterized by immune alterations and inflammation, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can sleep aid in the treatment of a fever?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, sleep deprivation has a significant impact on immune response effectiveness. In addition, lack of sleep impairs immune function, making people more susceptible to viral infections, particularly the common cold. This is usually due to decreased <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417606/\">T lymphocyte proliferation</a></span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417606/\">decreased expression of HLA-DR molecules</a></span>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417606/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">increased CD14 positive cells</span></a>, and&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25640603/\">induction of cortisol inflammatory markers</a></span>. Thus, sleep deprivation affects how we fight illnesses once they strike viral infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-should-sleep-disruptions-be-addressed\">How should sleep disruptions be addressed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep disorders are a group of medical conditions that impair one&#8217;s ability to sleep soundly on a regular basis. These are mainly the results of medical conditions or excessive stress. Since a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29348984/\">cause-and-effect relationship between sleep deprivation and immune suppression</a></span> has been proposed, sleep disruption should be treated in terms of both time and quality to maintain a healthy immune response.

Although physical activity is one of the most effective ways to avoid migraine attacks, consult a neurologist to develop a suitable migraine prevention strategy.</div>\n<p>Migraines are a type of headache disorder, in which there is moderate to severe throbbing pain, nausea, and a greater susceptibility to external influences or the environment. This severe headache can be a result of a variety of factors, one of which is strenuous gym work. Therefore, this article focuses on important aspects of gym-induced migraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does strenuous workout cause migraines?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16483514/\">Exertion is a well-known and frequent migraine trigger</a></span>. In fact, one of the criteria for a migraine diagnosis is the onset of a headache with a specific movement or activity. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16483514/\">Strenuous workouts such as weightlifting, running, and even cycling</a></span> can aggravate this gym-induced migraine. Exercise may result in an acute release of neuropeptides or a change in hypocretin or lactate metabolism. However, the precise mechanism by which strenuous activity causes migraines is still unknown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the fact that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880028/\">intense workouts can trigger migraines</a></span>, numerous studies have found that a lack of exercise, inactivity, or a sedentary lifestyle can also induce migraines. Therefore, it is always a good idea to consult with your doctor or neurologist about finding a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21890526/\">suitable physical fitness regimen</a></span> that can act as a migraine preventer while also avoiding a triggering effect from overexertion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should someone exercise in the gym during a migraine attack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, if the migraine episode is persistent or severe, it is not advisable to continue exercising or exerting oneself physically. However, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32529311/\">exercise may be beneficial in the prevention of migraine attacks</a></span>. Regrettably, it has not been shown to stop a migraine attack once it has begun. As a result, the best workout regimen is one that they can perform safely. For the vast majority of migraine sufferers, migraines are extremely distracting, if not downright debilitating. Hence, it is best to pause the exercise until the episode has passed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there may be some triggers of migraine due to strenuous exercises in gym, you should not ignore the positive impact of physical activity on migraine relief. Thus, you should have a consistent fitness routine under the consultation of our doctor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-are-the-benefits-of-regular-exercise-greater-than-the-risks-of-migraine-triggers-at-the-gym\">Are the benefits of regular exercise greater than the risks of migraine triggers at the gym?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it is generally beneficial for the majority of migraine sufferers. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18783448/\">Aerobic exercises</a></span><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18783448/\">,</a> yoga, and light stretching can all improve one&#8217;s overall cardiovascular, neurological, and behavioral health. Migraines, on the other hand, can be so severe and incapacitating that they can ruin a person&#8217;s entire day.

Several misconceptions about the dangers posed by fever development have persisted over time. In this compilation, we will discuss the significance, benefits, and limitations of body temperature rise, and fever as a therapy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-what-is-the-significance-of-fever\">What is the significance of fever?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fever is not always harmful. The most common cause of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21843857/\">f</a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21843857/\">ever is an infection or a normal inflammatory response to trauma or surgery</a></span>. Fever is neither a good predictor of infection nor should it automatically require an immediate workup. You should not use <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19667898/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">antibiotics to treat a fever unless the underlying </span></a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19667898/\">condition is identified</a></span>. Patients with mild fevers within 24 hours of expected discharge should not be kept in the hospital. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19667898/\">Suppressing fever unnecessarily may be harmful in some patients</a></span>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is fever therapeutic?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, fever could be used as a therapy. Fever appears to have evolved in humans as an adaptive infection-control mechanism. Certain stressors or microorganisms cause the release of a fever-inducing hormone. This induced chemical mediator then circulates to the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30454596/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">hypothalamus, the brain&#8217;s thermoregulatory center</span></a>, raising the &#8220;set point&#8221; for normal body temperature. Typically, shivering, increasing heat production, decreasing heat loss, or simply seeking a warmer environment cause fever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fever is essentially an impairment in normal thermoregulation. Thus, rise in body temperature requires mediators such as prostaglandins and catecholamines. As a result, higher body temperatures may benefit an infected host by increasing the activity of their defense system. This, in turn, enhances some aspects of the early inflammatory response, resulting in increased white blood cell emigration and local infection containment. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698993/\">Fever patterns are especially useful in eliminating diagnoses and indicating previously unknown disorders</a></span> that may be detected by additional procedures. Thus, a rise in body temperature is a key indicator of an infection or underlying condition and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35820685/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">could be defensive up to a certain point</span></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical professionals have been using Pyrotherapy, or artificial fever induction for long, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27648506/\">particularly in the treatment of psychotic diseases</a></span>. You should not confuse pyrotherapy with a rise in body temperature, which is a result of a foreign infection or medical condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is there any limitation to fever as a therapy?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. In humans, the role of fever as a therapy in host defense has never been satisfactorily proven. Fevers may be effective in neutralizing mild infections caused by specific microorganisms. However, there are some <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698993/\">circumstances in which a rise in body</a></span> temperature is only indicative and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8698993/\">not actually a treatment.</a></span> Infections may not always cause such fevers.

ਜੋ ਦੰਦਾਂ &#8216;ਤੇ ਬੈਕਟੀਰੀਆ ਦੇ ਕਾਰਨ ਵਿਕਸਤ ਹੁੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਕੁਦਰਤੀ ਤੌਰ &#8216;ਤੇ ਮੂੰਹ ਵਿੱਚ ਰਹਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਪਲੇਕ ਵਿਚਲੇ ਬੈਕਟੀਰੀਆ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਖਾਣ ਜਾਂ ਪੀਣ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ ਐਸਿਡ ਪੈਦਾ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ। ਇਹ ਐਸਿਡ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਪਰਲੇ ਨੂੰ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਖੋੜ ਅਤੇ ਮਸੂੜਿਆਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਬਿਮਾਰੀਆਂ ਦਾ ਕਾਰਨ ਬਣ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ। ਐਸਿਡ ਜੋ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਪਰਲੀ ਨੂੰ ਦੂਰ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦੇ ਹਨ, ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਸੜਨ ਵੱਲ ਲੈ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅਤੇ ਜੇਕਰ ਇਹ ਐਸਿਡ ਸਾਫ਼ ਨਹੀਂ ਕੀਤੇ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ, ਤਾਂ ਇਹ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਮਿੱਝ ਤੱਕ ਡੈਂਟਿਨ ਦੁਆਰਾ ਜਾਰੀ ਰਹਿ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅੰਤ ਵਿੱਚ ਲਾਗ ਦਾ ਕਾਰਨ ਬਣਦੇ ਹਨ। ਦੂਜੇ ਸ਼ਬਦਾਂ ਵਿਚ, ਜੇਕਰ ਦੰਦਾਂ &#8216;ਤੇ ਪਲੇਕ ਨੂੰ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਛੱਡ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਤਾਂ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਸੜਨ ਅਤੇ ਕੈਵਿਟੀਜ਼ ਹੋ ਸਕਦੀਆਂ ਹਨ।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ਕੀ ਅਸੀਂ ਪਲੇਕ ਨੂੰ ਹਟਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਐਪਲ ਸਾਈਡਰ ਵਿਨੇਗਰ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰੀਏ?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ਨਹੀਂ। ਇਹ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਚਮਕਦਾਰ ਬਣਾਉਣ ਲਈ ਬਲੀਚਿੰਗ ਏਜੰਟਾਂ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਇੱਕ ਹੈ। ਭਾਵੇਂ ਐਪਲ ਸਾਈਡਰ ਵਿਨੇਗਰ (ACV) ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਨ ਤੋਂ ਬਾਅਦ, ਦੰਦ ਸਾਫ਼ ਦਿਖਾਈ ਦੇ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਬਾਇਓਫਿਲਮ ਨੂੰ ਹਟਾ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ, ਅਸਲ ਵਿੱਚ, ਇਹ ਚੰਗੇ ਨਾਲੋਂ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਕਰ ਰਿਹਾ ਹੈ। ਐਪਲ ਸਾਈਡਰ ਵਿਨੇਗਰ ਦਾ pH ਲਗਭਗ 2-3 ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ, ਇਸਦਾ ਸੁਭਾਅ ਬਹੁਤ ਤੇਜ਼ਾਬ ਵਾਲਾ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਪਲਾਕ ਨੂੰ ਘੁਲਣ ਤੋਂ ਇਲਾਵਾ, ਇਹ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਖਣਿਜਾਂ ਜਿਵੇਂ ਕਿ ਕੈਲਸ਼ੀਅਮ ਅਤੇ ਫਾਸਫੋਰਸ ਨੂੰ ਵੀ ਚੀਲੇਟ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਖਣਿਜ ਸਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਅਤੇ ਹੱਡੀਆਂ ਦੇ ਬਿਲਡਿੰਗ ਬਲਾਕ ਹਨ, ਜੋ ਕਿ ACV ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਕਰਕੇ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਹੋ ਜਾਂਦੇ ਹਨ। ਆਖਰਕਾਰ, ਸੇਬ ਸਾਈਡਰ ਸਿਰਕੇ ਦੀ ਲਗਾਤਾਰ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਸਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਬਣਾ ਦਿੰਦੀ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਖੋੜਾਂ ਦੇ ਵਿਕਾਸ ਦਾ ਖ਼ਤਰਾ ਬਣਾਉਂਦੀ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਬਦਤਰ ਮਾਮਲਿਆਂ ਵਿੱਚ, ਉਹਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਟੁੱਟਣ ਦਾ ਖ਼ਤਰਾ ਬਣ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ। </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img

height=\"168\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>ਸਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਮਾਹਿਰ <strong>ਡਾ. ਪੂਜਾ ਭਾਰਦਵਾਜ</strong> ਨੇ ਅੱਗੇ ਕਿਹਾ, “ਪਲਾਕ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੀ ਸਤ੍ਹਾ &#8216;ਤੇ ਭੋਜਨ ਦੇ ਮਲਬੇ ਅਤੇ ਬੈਕਟੀਰੀਆ ਦੀ ਇੱਕ ਪਤਲੀ, ਪਤਲੀ, ਹਟਾਉਣਯੋਗ ਪਰਤ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਉਦੋਂ ਬਣਦੀ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਅਸੀਂ ਕੁਝ ਖਾਂਦੇ ਜਾਂ ਪੀਂਦੇ ਹਾਂ। ਐਪਲ ਸਾਈਡਰ ਸਿਰਕਾ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਫੈਦ ਕਰਨ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਪ੍ਰਸਿੱਧ ਘਰੇਲੂ ਉਪਚਾਰ ਹੈ ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਇਹ ਰਸਾਇਣਕ ਤੌਰ &#8216;ਤੇ ਛੋਟੇ ਧੱਬਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ। ਹਾਲਾਂਕਿ, ਇਸਦੀ ਤੇਜ਼ਾਬ ਕੁਦਰਤ ਦੇ ਕਾਰਨ, ਇਹ ਮਸੂੜਿਆਂ ਨੂੰ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਪਹੁੰਚਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਇਹ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਖਣਿਜਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਵੀ ਨਸ਼ਟ ਕਰ ਦਿੰਦਾ ਹੈ ਜੋ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ ਕਰ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਉਹਨਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਖੋਲਾਂ ਲਈ ਵਧੇਰੇ ਸੰਵੇਦਨਸ਼ੀਲ ਬਣਾ ਸਕਦੇ ਹਨ।&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img

ਝੁਲਸਣ ਅਤੇ ਐਸਿਡ ਰਿਫਲਕਸ ਵਿੱਚ ਮਦਦ ਕਰਨ ਦਾ ਦਾਅਵਾ ਕਰਦਾ ਹੈ ਅਤੇ ਇਹ ਸ਼ੂਗਰ ਅਤੇ ਹਾਈ ਬਲੱਡ ਪ੍ਰੈਸ਼ਰ ਲਈ ਵੀ ਲਾਭਦਾਇਕ ਹੈ। ACV ਦੀ ਇੱਕ ਹੋਰ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਮੂੰਹ ਦੀ ਸਫਾਈ ਨੂੰ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਣ ਲਈ ਜ਼ਿੰਮੇਵਾਰ ਹੋ ਸਕਦੀ ਹੈ। . ਕਿਉਂਕਿ ਸਿਰਕੇ ਵਿੱਚ ਇੱਕ ਕੁਦਰਤੀ ਐਂਟੀਬੈਕਟੀਰੀਅਲ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵ ਹੁੰਦਾ ਹੈ ACV ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਸਤਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਸਾਫ਼ ਕਰਨ ਅਤੇ ਪਲੇਕ ਦੇ ਜਮ੍ਹਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਹਟਾਉਣ ਵਿੱਚ ਲਾਭਦਾਇਕ ਹੋ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ ਜਦੋਂ ਕਿ ਇਸਨੂੰ ਪਤਲੇ ਹੋਏ ਮਾਊਥਵਾਸ਼ ਵਜੋਂ ਵਰਤਦੇ ਹੋਏ। ਹਾਲਾਂਕਿ, ਇਹ ਯਾਦ ਰੱਖਣਾ ਜ਼ਰੂਰੀ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਸ ਘਰੇਲੂ ਉਪਾਅ ਦਾ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਤੁਹਾਡੇ ਦੰਦਾਂ ਦੇ ਪਰਲੇ ਨੂੰ ਨੁਕਸਾਨ ਪਹੁੰਚਾਉਂਦਾ ਹੈ। ਪਲੈਕ ਅਤੇ ਕੈਲਕੂਲਸ ਦੇ ਗਠਨ ਨੂੰ ਰੋਕਣ ਲਈ ਅਤੇ ਸ਼ਾਨਦਾਰ ਮੌਖਿਕ ਸਫਾਈ ਬਣਾਈ ਰੱਖਣ ਲਈ ਸਾਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਘੱਟੋ ਘੱਟ ਦੋ ਵਾਰ ਇੱਕ ਪੇਸ਼ੇਵਰ ਦੰਦਾਂ

ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਸ਼ੀਲਤਾ ਬਾਰੇ ਵੀਡੀਓਜ਼ ਅਤੇ ਬਲੌਗਾਂ ਨਾਲ ਭਰਿਆ ਹੋਇਆ ਹੈ। ਇਸ ਦੀ ਵਰਤੋਂ ਨਿੰਬੂ ਦਾ ਰਸ, ਦਹੀਂ, ਦੁੱਧ, ਓਟਮੀਲ, ਆਦਿ ਦੇ ਨਾਲ ਜਾਂ ਸੁਮੇਲ ਵਿੱਚ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਂਦੀ ਹੈ। ਆਲੂ ਦੇ ਚਮੜੀ ਨੂੰ ਚੰਗਾ ਕਰਨ ਦੇ ਲਾਭ ਇੱਕ ਐਨਜ਼ਾਈਮ ਕੈਟੇਕੋਲੇਜ਼ ਨੂੰ ਮੰਨਿਆ ਜਾਂਦਾ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਕੋਈ ਵਿਗਿਆਨਕ ਅਧਿਐਨ ਇਸਦਾ ਸਮਰਥਨ ਨਹੀਂ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ।  ਕੁਝ ਜਾਨਵਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਅਧਿਐਨਾਂ ਨੇ ਆਲੂ ਦੀ ਚਮੜੀ ਦੇ ਐਬਸਟਰੈਕਟ ਦੇ ਸਾੜ-ਵਿਰੋਧੀ ਪ੍ਰਭਾਵਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਦਿਖਾਇਆ ਹੈ, ਪਰ ਅਜੇ ਤੱਕ ਮਨੁੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਸ ਦੀ ਕੋਸ਼ਿਸ਼ ਕੀਤੀ ਜਾਣੀ ਬਾਕੀ ਹੈ। ਅਜਿਹੇ ਦਾਅਵੇ ਹਨ ਕਿ ਆਲੂ ਦੇ ਚਿਹਰੇ ਦਾ ਮਾਸਕ ਬੁਢਾਪੇ ਦੇ ਲੱਛਣਾਂ ਨੂੰ ਘਟਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ, ਚਮਕ ਵਧਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ, ਅਤੇ ਹਾਈਪਰਪੀਗਮੈਂਟੇਸ਼ਨ ਨੂੰ ਘਟਾ ਸਕਦਾ ਹੈ। ਫਿਰ ਵੀ, ਇਹ ਯਾਦ ਰੱਖਣਾ ਮਹੱਤਵਪੂਰਨ ਹੈ ਕਿ ਇਹਨਾਂ ਵਿੱਚੋਂ ਜ਼ਿਆਦਾਤਰ

ভেপোরাব।&#8221; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://archive.ph/gMY3B\">এইখানে সেই আর্টিকেলটি</a></span> দেখা যাবে । </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>সত্যানুন্ধান</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ভিক্স ভেপোরাব </strong>(<strong>Vicks Vaporub) কি ?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicks Vaporub হল সর্দি কাশি কম করার কাজে ব্যবহৃত বহু জনপ্রিয় একটি মলম । পৃথিবীর বহু দেশেই এই মলম পাওয়া যায় । ভারতে যেকোনো ওষুধের দোকানে সহজেই উপলব্ধ এই মলম । মলম উৎপাদনকারী <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://vicks.co.in/en-in/browse-products/decongestion-category/vicks-vaporub\">কোম্পানি-র ওয়েবসাইট অনুযায়ী</a></span> এই মলমটি ইউক্যালিপ্টাস গাছের নির্যাস, কর্পূর জাতীয় উৎপাদন ব্যবহার করে বানানো হয় এবং এর সর্দি কাশির নিরাময়ে গলায় বা বুকে এই মলম মালিশ করাটা এর স্বীকৃত ব্যবহার ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>কানে ব্যথা হওয়ার বিভিন্ন কারণ কী?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>কানের ব্যথা (otalgia) বিভিন্ন কারণে হতে পারে, যেমন eustachian টিউবে বাধা, কানে ইনফেকশন, কানে আঘাত লাগা , কানের পর্দায় ছিদ্র, উচ্চতা চাপ পরিবর্তন (বারোট্রমা) ইত্যাদি। কখনও কখনও, একজন ব্যক্তি বিভিন্ন অন্য শারীরিক সমস্যার কারণেও কানে ব্যথা অনুভব করতে পারেন, যেমন- সাইনাস, গলা ব্যথা, দাঁতের সংক্রমণ, Temporomandibular joint syndrome (টিএমজে) ইত্যাদি।  কানের ভিতরে যে ব্যথা শুরু হয় তাকে প্রাইমারি ওটালজিয়া বলা হয়, কানের বাইরের ব্যথা  সেকেন্ডারি ওটালজিয়া নামে পরিচিত।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ভিক্স ভে<strong>পোরাব </strong>(<strong>Vicks Vaporub)</strong> কি কানের ব্যথা সরিয়ে তুলতে পারে?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>না। এর কোনো বৈজ্ঞানিক প্রমাণ বা গবেষণা নেই। কানের ব্যথার জন্য Vicks Vaporub ব্যবহার করার পরামর্শ দেওয়া হয় না । ভিক্স এ ব্যবহৃত উপাদানগুলো যেমন কর্পূর ইত্যাদি হয়তো ব্যাথার অনুভব সাময়িক ভাবে কম করতে পারে কিন্তু এটি রোগের নিরাময় নয় । কানের ব্যাথা হলে ডাক্তারের পরামর্শ নিয়ে ব্যাথার আসল কারণটা যাচাই করে দেখা উচিত কোনো ইনফেকশনের কারণে যদি ব্যাথা হয়ে থাকে তাহলে তার চিকিৎসা করা দরকার । ভিক্স কানের ভিতরের কন রকম infection ঠিক করতে পারেনা । এই ক্রিমের অতিরিক্ত ব্যাবহারের ফলে &#8211; এটি কানের পর্দা ব্লক করে দিতে পারে, যার ফলে  শুনতে অসুবিধে হতে পারে । অনেক ব্যবহারকারী তুলোতে <strong>Vicks নিয়ে </strong> কানে লাগানোর পরামর্শ দিয়েছেন। তুলার টুকরো কানে আটকে যেতে পারে, যার ফলে ব্যাকটেরিয়া সংক্রমণ এবং অন্যান্য জটিলতা দেখা দিতে পারে। </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ENT Specialist, ড: প্রিয়জিৎ পানিগ্রাহী</strong>, <strong>MBBS, DNB, MNAMS এই বিষয়ে জানান- </strong>“Vicks Vaporub-এ রয়েছে 3টি প্রধান উপাদান কর্পূর, ইউক্যালিপটাস তেল এবং মেন্থল, থাইমল ইত্যাদি। প্রধানত, এটি সর্দি ও কাশি কম করতে ব্যবহৃত হয়।  কানের ভিতর <strong>Vicks</strong> রাখলে ঠাণ্ডা অনুভূতি হবে, হতো সাময়িক ভাবে ব্যাথার অনুভবও কম হতে পারে । কিন্তু এটা কোনো বৈজ্ঞানিক মতে চিকিৎসা নয় । তবুও, আমাদের সতর্কতা অবলম্বন করতে হবে কারণ কানের ভিতরে ভিক্স বা তুলোর টুকরো থেকে গেলে সেটি আরো বিপত্তি বাড়িয়ে তুলতে পারে ।

However, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25455943/\">a menstrual cycle or a visible medical condition affecting the body in conjunction with the cycle could result in an elevated body temperature</a></span>.

Broadly, they are classified into functional cysts and pathological cysts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functional ovarian cysts are non-cancerous and harmless. Sometimes, they can cause pelvic pain. These are associated with the menstrual cycle. This occurs when a woman has not been through menopause. If, during a menstrual cycle, a follicle doesn’t release an egg or does not discharge its fluid and shrinks after the egg is released, it becomes a cyst. In most cases, they disappear in a few months without needing any treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathological cysts are usually non-cancerous. However, sometimes, these can be cancerous. They are caused by abnormal cell growth and are unrelated to the menstrual cycle. These can develop before and after menopause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can occur from either the cells used to create eggs or the cells that cover the outer part of the ovary and may block the blood supply to the ovaries. These are surgically removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are ovarian cysts normal?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ovarian cysts are the fluid-filled sacs in the ovaries. They commonly occur in women of all ages. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539572/\">These cysts</a></span> often develop due to normal hormonal changes during puberty or menopause. In some rare cases, they are already present at birth. Most of them form during ovulation. The most common type, functional cysts, form during the menstrual cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain factors that increase the risk of developing ovarian cysts are hormone changes, consumption of fertility drugs, pregnancy, endometriosis and a severe pelvic infection that spreads to your ovaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can ovarian cysts be harmful?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes. In most cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own and do not always require treatment. In premenopausal women, they usually resolve within a few months without treatment.

Another well-known phenomenon is that any painful distress to the territory of the trigeminal nerves can cause headaches in patients who are predisposed to headache conditions.

The most common are teeth grinding or clenching, impacted wisdom teeth, cracked tooth as well as complications from untreated dental cavities. Some conditions can cause migraines even if they have nothing to do with tooth-related problems or headache disorders. These include sinus infections, trigeminal neuralgia, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24482784/\">TMJ disorders</a></span>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How should toothache-induced migraine be managed?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One should not overlook the ability of oral pathologies to cause or contribute to headaches.

It is a yoga hand position which resembles the shape of a ‘conch’ (<em>shankh</em>). The word Shankh refers to the &#8216;Conch Shell&#8217;, and Mudra represents the &#8216;Hand Gesture&#8217;. With this mudra, the pressure of the thumb of one hand falls on the palm of the other hand, and the pressure of the bent fingers of the other hand falls on the thumb of the same hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://static.thip.media/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18221010/IMG_0822-Ayush-Chandra-1-scaled-e1668789651486-721x800.jpg\" alt=\"Yoga Practitioner\" class=\"wp-image-37675\" width=\"181\" height=\"185\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><span><b>Dr. Ayush Chandra, Corporate Yoga Trainer certified by the </b><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ministry of AYUSH</strong></span><strong>, Consultant Diabetologist, <strong>and</strong></strong> <strong>Founder of Nivaran Health Delhi NCR,</strong> elaborates on this by stating, “Shankh mudra is also known as the Conch shell mudra because at the time of practicing this mudra your hand takes a conch shell shape. Regular practice purifies the respiratory system and expands the peaceful feeling and positivity. It is also performed at the start of mediation to clear and purify your inner energy levels.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the health benefits of Shankh mudra?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Yoga practitioners, this mudra is helpful in several ways. As it involves chanting of ‘OM’, the vibration created is believed to stimulate the thyroid gland and help in thyroid diseases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, <strong>Dr. Chandra</strong> enlists the other benefits, such as the following-&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is useful for voice and respiratory problems like a sore throat.</li><li>It helps in making the nervous system strong.</li><li>It is considered to improve stammering in children.</li><li>It is effective for skin allergies and rashes.</li><li>Shankh Mudra is effective in improving the functioning of the heart and increasing appetite.</li><li>It also helps to overcome nervousness and anxiety.</li><li>Lastly, this mudra helps to better function the vocal cord and gives quality to your speech and voice by restoring pitch and resonance.”</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Can Shankh mudra increase height at any age?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exactly. There needs to be more research to prove that practicing this mudra would increase height at any age. As per yoga practitioners, shankh mudra might help increase your height, but only if you are in the growing stage. It has been proven by various studies that the practice of Yoga might help in increasing height, but various other factors determine the height. A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://ijirt.org/master/publishedpaper/IJIRT153164_PAPER.pdf\">study by Aligarh Muslim University</a></span> concluded that with the practice of yoga, a significant difference was found in the experimental group concerning height.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6177663/#:~:text=Human%20growth%20is%20affected%20by,%2C%20and%20puberty%20%5B7%5D.\"> research</a></span>, the factors which affect human growth include “genes, race, birth weight, hormones, nutrition, and environment.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266869/\">The Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism </a></span>also states that “There are several variables that may influence directly or indirectly pubertal growth spurt including, gender, genetics, nutrition, endocrine regulation, physical activity and ethnicity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical activity and Yoga might indeed help you in increasing your height, but even regular exercise and a healthy diet are unlikely to influence your height after a certain age. The bone development stops, and then it is not possible to grow anymore. The DNA is responsible for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/traits/height/\">around 80%</a></span> of your height. Also, a few conditions, such as Down Syndrome, Turner Syndrome and achondroplasia, may cause delayed or stunted growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Chandra</strong> puts his view on this question and states, “Shankh mudra might help those who want to increase their height. Practicing this mudra daily helps you to activate the thyroid gland, which further works with growth hormone and helps us to increase the height of your body. Yoga can help you grow taller as it stretches the spine, lengthens the back and leg muscles, and improves posture. It also detoxifies your body, encouraging healthy cell growth. Yoga on a regular and consistent basis reduces stress. As a result, growth hormones are released, naturally increasing height. But, it is very important to note here that there is no evidence that this mudra can increase height as bone development stops after an age. There is no medical evidence that height can increase after a certain age as then bones can’t develop any more.”&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can height be increased with practicing mudra daily?

People also misconstrue migraine with other headaches, or vice versa. Keeping an eye on the duration and frequency of migraine symptoms can help people self-diagnose migraine. The symptoms can better be understood with the stages of migraine. Migraine has four stages of prodrome, aura, attack, and post-drome.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the symptoms of a migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prodrome stage has symptoms of constipation, mood changes, food cravings, stiff neck, increased urination, fluid retention, and frequent yawning. The aura stage shows symptoms of visual loss, visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light, pins and needles sensations, weakness or numbness, and difficulty speaking.<br>The attack stage shows symptoms of pain in the head, pain that throbs or pulses, sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch, nausea, and vomiting. The post-drome stage comes after a migraine attack is over. People feel drained, confused, and washed out. Some people also feel elated. However, the migraine pain can arise again at this stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I have a migraine test?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No. No specific test can diagnose migraine at home or even at the doctor’s place. For an accurate diagnosis, a general physician identifies the pattern of headaches through medical history, symptoms, and a physical and neurological examination. In a complex scenario, the doctor can also conduct a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan to diagnose brain damage.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to diagnose migraine at home?

Obesity is a risk factor for migraine pain. The available evidence shows overweight people are at more significant risk of developing migraine. This means losing weight can help obese people with migraine avoid frequent headaches. A healthy and active lifestyle can control migraine to a great extent.</div>\n<p>Migraine and obesity have a connection. Obesity causes migraine and the risk of migraine increases with weight gain. People with migraine and healthy body weights are at a lower risk of headaches than people with migraine who are overweight. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-obesity/\">American Migraine Foundation website</a></span> informs obesity five times increases the chance of developing chronic migraine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obesity does not cause migraine. Rather, it’s a risk factor. This means being obese makes it more likely to develop migraine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the answer below, we have explained the impact of weight on the frequency of migraine attacks and other common questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does weight gain cause migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible. Weight can cause migraine because obesity is a changeable risk factor for headaches. The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16354886/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">available scientific evidence</span></a> shows that obesity keeps the body in an abnormal state. In this state, the body produces pain-generating hormones. Similar pain-generating hormones are released during a migraine attack. This explains a reason why obese people might suffer from regular migraine attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-losing-weight-help-with-migraine\">Can losing weight help with migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible. Losing weight can <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640582/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">reduce</span></a> the risk of migraine. A <a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640582/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">study published in 2013</span></a> shows that overweight people can reduce the severity and frequency of migraines by shedding a few calories. In cases where overweight people suffer from mild migraine attacks, maintaining a healthy weight can completely remove the chance of getting frequent headaches. This means maintaining a healthy weight through lifestyle changes can reduce migraine symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can a healthy diet reduce migraine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To a certain extent. There is no specific ‘migraine diet’ that can cure the condition or reduce regular attacks. However, a good diet can help overweight people shed extra calories. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7352457/\">Research published in 2020</a></span> shows ketogenic, high-folate, low-fat, modified Atkins, and high omega-3/low omega-6 diets can help people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the chance of regular migraine attacks.</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Does weight gain cause migraine?
